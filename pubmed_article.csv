First, the captured DNA (cDNA) is self-assembled on the electrode surface and hybridizes with the TMV RNA (tRNA) to form cDNA/tRNA hybrids. And then the initiator of ARGET ATRP (Î±-bromoisobutyric acid, BMP) is attached to the cDNA via an amide bond and later triggers ARGET ATRP. Many electroactive monomers (ferrocenylmethyl methacrylate, FMMA) are polymerized and a remarkable electrical signal response of ferrocene (Fc) is obtained. However, with the present of DSN, DSN cleaves the cDNA/tRNA hybrid and releases tRNA to hybridize with another cDNA, thereby causing significant shortening of the length of the cDNA. The number of polymer chains on the electrode surface is drastically reduced, which is followed by a noticeable reduction in the signal of Fc. The method shows high sensitivity, superior selectivity, excellent stability and good reproducibility under optimal conditions with the limit of detection (LOD) of 2.9 fM. Furthermore, the biosensor showed satisfactory applicability in detecting tRNA in real samples, thereby demonstrating the potential of the method for practical TMV RNA detection.",eng,2021,12,08,2021,12,16,ppublish,Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D014027,ARGET ATRP|DSN-assisted target recycling|Electrochemical biosensor|Tobacco mosaic virus

When infected with CMV in the presence of Y-satellite RNA (Y-sat), tobacco leaves develop a green mosaic, then turn yellow. Y-sat has been identified in the fields in Japan. Here, we show that the yellow leaf colour preferentially attracts aphids, and that the aphids fed on yellow plants, which harbour Y-sat-derived small RNAs (sRNAs), turn red and subsequently develop wings. In addition, we found that leaf yellowing did not necessarily reduce photosynthesis, and that viral transmission was not greatly affected despite the low viral titer in the Y-sat-infected plants. Y-sat-infected plants can therefore support a sufficient number of aphids to allow for efficient virus transmission.

These chemical compounds and their derivatives exhibit hazardous effects on habitats and human life too. Hence, there's a need to develop novel, more effective and safe bio-control agents. A variety of microbes such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi possess a great potential to fight against phytopathogens and thus can be used as bio-control agents instead of harmful chemical compounds. These naturally occurring microorganisms are applied to the plants in order to control phytopathogens. Moreover, practicing them appropriately for agriculture management can be a way towards a sustainable approach. The MBCAs follow various modes of action and act as elicitors where they induce a signal to activate plant defense mechanisms against a variety of pathogens. MBCAs control phytopathogens and help in disease suppression through the production of enzymes, antimicrobial compounds, antagonist activity involving hyper-parasitism, induced resistance, competitive inhibition, etc. Efficient recognition of pathogens and prompt defensive response are key factors of induced resistance in plants. This resistance phenomenon is pertaining to a complex cascade that involves an increased amount of defensive proteins, salicylic acid (SA), or induction of signaling pathways dependent on plant hormones. Although, there's a dearth of information about the exact mechanism of plant-induced resistance, the studies conducted at the physiological, biochemical and genetic levels.

In transformed transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants, these promoter constructs showed constitutive expression. Based on the activity and gene expression patterns of these three promoter constructs, a fragment of 384 bp (named PmVP) was deduced to contain the full-length promoter of the PMVBV genome.

Mulberry mosaic dwarf-associated virus (MMDaV), identified from Chinese mulberry trees via small RNA-based deep sequencing, is a divergent monopartite geminivirus belonging to the genus Mulcrilevirus of the family Geminiviridae. Previous studies have shown that plants employ multiple layers of defence to protect themselves from geminivirus infection. The interplay between plant and MMDaV is nevertheless less studied. This study presents evidence that MMDaV triggers hypersensitive response (HR)-mediated antiviral defence in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. We show that the RepA protein of MMDaV is engaged in HR-type cell death induction. We find that the RepA mutants with compromised nuclear localization ability impair their capabilities of cell death induction. Virus-induced gene silencing of the key components of the R protein-mediated signalling pathway reveals that down-regulation of the nucleus-targeting NbWRKY1 alleviates the cell death induction activity of RepA. We further demonstrate that RepA up-regulates the transcript level of NbWRKY1. Furthermore, expression of RepA in N.Â benthamiana confers plant resistance against two begomoviruses. We propose that plant resistance against RepA can be potentially used to improve plant defence against geminiviruses in crops.",eng,2021,11,05,2021,11,6,ppublish,Begomovirus|Cell Death|Geminiviridae|Morus|Plant Diseases|Satellite Viruses|Tobacco|Transcription Factors,D053839|D016923|D017791|D031625|D010935|D012526|D014026|D014157,MMDaV|RepA|WRKY|antiviral response|cell death|geminivirus

48,34636879,Plant physiology,Two TOBAMOVIRUS MULTIPLICATION 2A homologs in tobacco control asymptomatic response to tobacco mosaic virus.,10.1093/plphys/kiab448,"The most common response of a host to pathogens is arguably the asymptomatic response. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for asymptomatic responses to pathogens are poorly understood. Here we report on the genetic cloning of two genes controlling the asymptomatic response to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in cultivated tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). These two genes are homologous to tobamovirus multiplication 2A (TOM2A) from Arabidopsis, which was shown to be critical for the accumulation of TMV. Expression analysis indicates that the TOM2A genes might play fundamental roles in plant development or in responses to stresses. Consistent with this hypothesis, a null allele of the TOM2A ortholog in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) led to the development of bent branches and a high tolerance to both TMV and tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). However, the TOM2A ortholog in Nicotiana glauca did not account for the asymptomatic response to TMV in N. glauca. We showed that TOM2A family is plant-specific and originated from Chlorophyte, and the biological functions of TOM2A orthologs to promote TMV accumulation are highly conserved in the plant kingdom-in both TMV host and nonhost species.

However, the mechanism governing the involvement of MYBs in regulating tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) resistance in plants is still unclear. In this study, we found that not only is Nicotiana benthamiana MYB4-like involved in defence against TMV, but also that the ethylene pathway participates in MYB4L-mediated resistance. Transcription of NbMYB4L was up-regulated in N.Â benthamiana infected with TMV. Silencing of NbMYB4L led to intensified TMV replication, whereas overexpression of NbMYB4L induced significant resistance to TMV. Transcription of NbMYB4L was greater in 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC, ethylene precursor)-pretreated plants but lower when the ethylene signalling pathway was blocked during TMV infection. Gene expression analysis showed that the transcription of NbMYB4L was largely suppressed in ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE 3-like 1(EIL1)-silenced plants. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) experiments indicated that NbEIL1 could directly bind to two specific regions of the NbMYB4L promoter. Furthermore, a luciferase assay revealed that NbEIL1 significantly induced the reporter activity of the MYB4L promoter in N.Â benthamiana. These results point to NbEIL1 functioning as a positive regulator of NbMYB4L transcription in N.Â benthamiana against TMV.

We previously reported that pre-treatment of Nicotiana benthamiana with acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) both suppressed the accumulation of plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV) in inoculated leaves and delayed the long-distance movement to uninoculated upper leaves. These two effects occurred independently of each other. However, it remained unclear where and when the viral long-distance movement is inhibited upon ASM treatment. In this study, we found that ASM treatment restricted the loading of GFP-expressing PlAMV (PlAMV-GFP) into vascular tissues in the inoculated leaves. This led to delays in viral translocation to the petiole and the main stem, and to untreated upper leaves. We used cryohistological fluorescence imaging to show that ASM treatment affected the viral localization and reduced its accumulation in the phloem, xylem, and mesophyll tissues. A stem girdling experiment, which blocked viral movement downward through phloem tissues, demonstrated that ASM treatment could inhibit viral systemic infection to upper leaves, which occurred even with viral downward movement restricted. Taken together, our results showed that ASM treatment affects the loading of PlAMV-GFP into the vascular system in the inoculated leaf, and that this plays a key role in the ASM-mediated delay of viral long-distance movement.",eng,2021,10,12,2021,10,9,ppublish,Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Potexvirus|Thiadiazoles|Tobacco,D010935|D018515|D017863|D013830|D014026,acibenzolar-S-methyl|cryo-histological protocols|long-distance movement|vascular tissues|viral loading steps

Upon TVBMV infection, NbRPL1 was recruited into the 6K2-induced viral replication complexes in chloroplasts. Silencing of NbRPL1 expression reduced TVBMV replication. NbRPL1 competed with NbBeclin1 to bind NIb, and reduced the NbBeclin1-mediated degradation of NIb.

The association of IP-L with NbAS-B was further confirmed by in vivo co-immunoprecipitation, luciferase complementation imaging, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. IP-L and NbAS-B interact in the nucleus and cytosol and IP-L apparently stabilizes NbAS-B, thus enhancing its accumulation. The expressions of IP-L and NbAS-B are continuously induced on TMV-green fluorescent protein (GFP) infection. Co-silencing of IP-L and NbAS-B facilitates TMV-GFP infection. Overexpression of NbAS-B in tobacco reduces TMV-GFP infection by significantly improving the synthesis of asparagine.

Although several VIGS vectors for maize (Zea mays) have been previously developed, their utilities are limited due to low viral infection efficiency, insert instability, short maintenance of silencing, inadequate inoculation method, or abnormal requirement of growth temperature. Here, we established a Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-based VIGS system for efficient maize gene silencing that overcomes many limitations of VIGS currently available for maize. Using two distinct strains, CMV-ZMBJ and CMV-Fny, we generated a pseudorecombinant-chimeric (Pr) CMV. Pr CMV showed high infection efficacy but mild viral symptoms in maize. We then constructed Pr CMV-based vectors for VIGS, dubbed Pr CMV VIGS. Pr CMV VIGS is simply performed by mechanical inoculation of young maize leaves with saps of Pr CMV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana under normal growth conditions. Indeed, suppression of isopentenyl/dimethylallyl diphosphate synthase (ZmIspH) expression by Pr CMV VIGS resulted in non-inoculated leaf bleaching as early as 5 d post-inoculation (dpi) and exhibited constant and efficient systemic silencing over the whole maize growth period up to 105 dpi. Furthermore, utilizing a ligation-independent cloning (LIC) strategy, we developed a modified Pr CMV-LIC VIGS vector, allowing easy gene cloning for high-throughput silencing in maize. Thus, our Pr CMV VIGS system provides a much-improved toolbox to facilitate efficient and long-duration gene silencing for large-scale functional genomics in maize, and our pseudorecombination-chimera combination strategy provides an approach to construct efficient VIGS systems in plants.",eng,,,,2021,10,5,ppublish,Chimera|Cucumovirus|Gene Silencing|Genomics|Tobacco|Zea mays,D002678|D017799|D020868|D023281|D014026|D003313,

The PDA-coated particles (Gd-Cy5-TMV-PDA) showed a shorter plasma circulation time and broader distribution to organs of the reticuloendothelial system (liver, lungs, and spleen) than uncoated Gd-Cy5-TMV particles (liver and spleen only). The Gd-Cy5-TMV-PDA particles were surrounded by 2-10-fold greater protein corona (containing mainly immunoglobulins) compared to Gd-Cy5-TMV particles. However, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed that PDA-coated particles bind 2-fold lesser to anti-TMV antibodies elicited by particle injection than uncoated particles, suggesting that the PDA coat enables evasion from systemic antibody surveillance. Gd-Cy5-TMV-PDA particles were cleared from organs after 8 days compared to 5 days for the uncoated particles. The slower tissue clearance of the coated particles makes them ideal for theranostic applications by facilitating sustained local delivery in addition to multimodal imaging and photothermal capabilities.

Several SAR signals have been characterized, but the nature of the other unknown signalling by small metabolites in SAR remains unclear.

Here, a combination of a chemical, virus-induced gene-silencing-based genetics approach, and transgenic technology was undertaken to investigate the role of GSH in plant viral resistance in Nicotiana benthamiana. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection results in increasing the expression of GSH biosynthesis genes NbECS and NbGS, and GSH content. Silencing of NbECS or NbGS accelerated oxidative damage, increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), compromised plant resistance to TMV, and suppressed the salicylic acid (SA)-mediated signalling pathway. Application of GSH or l-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (a GSH activator) alleviated oxidative damage, decreased accumulation of ROS, elevated plant local and systemic resistance, enhanced the SA-mediated signalling pathway, and increased the expression of ROS scavenging-related genes.

In vivo and in vitro assays showed that eEF1A does not interact with CWMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that eEF1A can specifically bind to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of CWMV genomic RNAs.

The induction of antiviral R-gene-mediated resistance often results in a hypersensitive response (HR), which is characterized by virus containment in the initially infected tissues and programmed cell death (PCD) of the infected cells. Alternatively, systemic HR (SHR) is sometimes observed in certain R gene-virus combinations, such that the virus systemically infects the plant and PCD induction follows the spread of infection, resulting in systemic plant death. SHR has been suggested to be the result of inefficient resistance induction; however, no quantitative comparison has been performed to support this hypothesis. In this study, we report that the average number of viral genomes that establish cell infection decreased by 28.7% and 12.7% upon HR induction by wild-type cucumber mosaic virus and SHR induction by a single-amino acid variant, respectively. These results suggest that a small decrease in the level of resistance induction can change an HR to an SHR. Although SHR appears to be a failure of resistance at the individual level, our simulations imply that suicidal individual death in SHR may function as an antiviral mechanism at the population level, by protecting neighboring uninfected kin plants.",eng,2021,08,09,2021,8,11,epublish,"Cucumovirus|Disease Resistance|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Genes, vpr|Plant Diseases|Plant Proteins|Tobacco",D017799|D060467|D018506|D016334|D010935|D010940|D014026,

NbNdhM-silenced plants were more susceptible to TuMV, whereas overexpression of NbNdhM inhibited TuMV accumulation. Overexpression of NbNdhM significantly induced the clustering of chloroplasts around the nuclei and disturbing this clustering facilitated TuMV infection, suggesting that the clustering mediated by NbNdhM is a defence against TuMV. It was then shown that NbNdhM interacted with TuMV VPg, and that the NdhMs of different plant species interacted with the proteins of different viruses, implying that NdhM may be a common target of viruses. In the presence of TuMV VPg, NbNdhM, which is normally localized in the nucleus, chloroplasts, cell periphery and chloroplast stromules, colocalized with VPg at the nucleus and nucleolus, with significantly increased nuclear accumulation, while NbNdhM-mediated chloroplast clustering was significantly impaired.

To understand XPO1 protein functions during potyvirus infections, we investigated the nuclear export of the NIb protein encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). Previously, we found that NIb is transported to the nucleus after translation and sumoylated by the sumoylation (small ubiquitin-like modifier) pathway to support viral infection. Here, we report that XPO1 interacts with NIb to facilitate translocation from the nucleus to the viral replication complexes (VRCs) that accumulate in the perinuclear regions of TuMV-infected cells. XPO1 contains two NIb-binding domains that recognize and interact with NIb in the nucleus and in the perinuclear regions, respectively, which facilitates TuMV replication. Moreover, XPO1 is involved in nuclear export of the sumoylated NIb and host factors tagged with SUMO3 that is essential for suppression of plant immunity in the nucleus. Deficiencies of XPO1 in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana plants inhibit TuMV replication and infection.

In this study, the targeting of the NSV tospoviral genomic RNA and mRNA molecules by antiviral RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISC) was investigated, in vitro and in planta. RISC fractions isolated from tospovirus-infected N. benthamiana plants specifically cleaved naked, purified tospoviral genomic RNAs in vitro, but not genomic RNAs complexed with viral N protein. In planta RISC complexes, activated by a tobacco rattle virus (TRV) carrying tospovirus NSs or Gn gene fragments, mainly targeted the corresponding viral mRNAs and hardly genomic (viral and viral-complementary strands) RNA assembled into RNPs. In contrast, for the (+)ssRNA cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), RISC complexes, activated by TRV carrying CMV 2a or 2b gene fragments, targeted CMV genomic RNA. Altogether, the results indicated that antiviral RNAi primarily targets tospoviral mRNAs whilst their genomic RNA is well protected in RNPs against RISC-mediated cleavage.

The genomic components of the begomovirus isolate, DNA A and betasatellite associated with ToLCD were cloned by rolling circle amplification method and sequenced. The sequence analysis revealed that the DNA A (2766 nt) of this isolate had the nucleotide identity of >91% with other strains of Tomato leaf curl Karnataka virus (ToLCKV), hence this isolate is proposed as a strain of ToLCKV, named as ToLCKV-Raipur. Similarly, the betasatellite molecule (1355 nt) had the highest identity of 91.1% with Corchorus yellow vein mosaic betasatellite (CoYVMB) and named as CoYVMB-Raipur. The full-length dimerized clones of these two genomic components were agroinoculated on natural (tomato), experimental (Nicotiana benthamiana) hosts and other 20 plant species belong to six different families. The severe leaf curl symptoms appeared only in the hosts, N. benthamiana, and in tomato inoculated with ToLCKV-Raipur alone and ToLCKV-Raipur with CoYVMB-Raipur after 8 and 16-18 days inoculation, respectively. This isolate was also transmissible to healthy tomato plants by whitefly from the tomato plant agroinoculated with ToLCKV-Raipur alone and with CoYVMB-Raipur and produced symptoms within 14-16 days after inoculation. Interestingly, this isolate infects horse gram and chilli by whitefly transmission and both the hosts showed positive for DNA A alone but not for betasatellite. Quantification of the genomic components of this isolate with the agroinoculated N. benthamiana samples by qRT-PCR results showed that the quantity of ToLCKV-Raipur was enhanced by three-fold while inoculated with CoYVMB-Raipur compared to ToLCKV-Raipur alone inoculated plants. However, CoYVMB-Raipur did not enhance the levels of ToLCKV-Raipur in the agroinoculated tomato plants.

Rsc4 from cultivar Dabaima is a dominant genetic locus for SMV resistance, and its mapping interval contains three nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat-containing (NLR) candidates (Rsc4-1, Rsc4-2, and Rsc4-3). The NLR-type resistant proteins were considered as important intracellular pathogen sensors in the previous studies. In this study, based on transient expression assay in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, we found that the longest transcript of Rsc4-3 is sufficient to confer resistance to SMV, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of Rsc4-3 in resistant cultivar Dabaima compromised the resistance.Â Interestingly, Rsc4-3 encodes a cell-wall-localized NLR-type resistant protein. We found that the internal polypeptide region responsible for apoplastic targeting of Rsc4-3 and the putative palmitoylation sites on the N terminus are essential for the resistance. Furthermore, we showed that viral-encoded cylindrical inclusion (CI) protein partially localizes to the cell wall and can interact with Rsc4-3. Virus-driven or transient expression of CI protein of avirulent SMV strains is enough to induce resistance response in the presence of Rsc4-3, suggesting that CI is the avirulent gene for Rsc4-3-mediated resistance. Taken together, our work identified a unique NLR that recognizes plant virus in the apoplast, and provided a simple and effective method for identifying resistant genes against SMV infection.",eng,2021,07,21,2021,7,25,ppublish,Cell Wall|Disease Resistance|Inclusion Bodies|Leucine-Rich Repeat Proteins|Plant Immunity|Plant Proteins|Potyvirus|Soybeans|Tobacco|Viral Proteins,D002473|D060467|D002479|D000090263|D057865|D010940|D017800|D013025|D014026|D014764,NLR|Rsc4|Soybean mosaic virus|cell wall|palmitoylation|resistance gene

TMV is typically produced in planta, and, as an RNA virus, is highly susceptible to natural mutation that may impact its properties. Over the course of 2 years, from 2018 until 2020, our laboratory followed a spontaneous point mutation in the TMV coat protein-first observed as a 30Â Da difference in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The mutation would have been difficult to notice by electrophoretic mobility in agarose or SDS-PAGE and does not alter viral morphology as assessed by transmission electron microscopy. The mutation responsible for the 30Â Da difference between the wild-type (wTMV) and mutant (mTMV) coat proteins was identified by a bottom-up proteomic approach as a change from glycine to serine at position 155 based on collision-induced dissociation data. Since residue 155 is located on the outer surface of the TMV rod, it is feasible that the mutation alters TMV surface chemistry. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbentÂ assays found no difference in binding between mTMV and wTMV. Functionalization of a nearby residue, tyrosine 139, with diazonium salt, also appears unaffected. Overall, this study highlights the necessity of standard workflows to quality-control viral stocks.

However, the effects of virus infection on host redox homeostasis and how antioxidant defense pathway is manipulated by viruses remain poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that the Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) Î³b protein is recruited to the chloroplast by the viral Î±a replicase to enhance viral replication. Here, we show that BSMV infection induces chloroplast oxidative stress. The versatile Î³b protein interacts directly with NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase C (NTRC), a core component of chloroplast antioxidant systems. Overexpression of NbNTRC significantly impairs BSMV replication in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, whereas disruption of NbNTRC expression leads to increased viral accumulation and infection severity. To counter NTRC-mediated defenses, BSMV employs the Î³b protein to competitively interfere with NbNTRC binding to 2-Cys Prx. Altogether, this study indicates that beyond acting as a helicase enhancer, Î³b also subverts NTRC-mediated chloroplast antioxidant defenses to create an oxidative microenvironment conducive to viral replication.",eng,2021,07,13,2021,7,14,ppublish,"Chloroplasts|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Oxidative Stress|Plant Proteins|Plant Viruses|Plants, Genetically Modified|Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase|Tobacco|Viral Nonstructural Proteins|Virus Replication",D002736|D054884|D018384|D010940|D010942|D030821|D013880|D014026|D017361|D014779,2-Cys Prx|NTRC|Viral replication|chloroplast antioxidant defenses|Î³b protein

Tobacco mosaic virus is known to affect crop production every year. The currently known inhibitors against TMV have a weak inhibition effect and also tend to be toxic towards non-target living organisms as well as the environment. Thus, the requirement of non-toxic potent inhibitors is the need of the hour, which led us to test our benzosuberene molecules on the binding site of TMV and check their affinity as well as stability. The non-toxic nature of these molecules has already been experimentally established. Through in-silico analysis involving docking and simulation experiments, we compared the interaction pattern of these ligand molecules with the already present inhibitors. Our investigation proved that the reported ligands (ligands 3, 7, 9, and 17 obtained -177.103, -228.632, -184.134, andÂ -Â 188.075Â kJ/mol binding energies, respectively) interacted with the binding site of TMV much efficiently than the known inhibitors (Ribavirin and Zhao et al. 2020 obtained 121.561 andÂ -Â 221.393Â kJ/mol binding energies, respectively).

This process occurs through the intercellular connections, termed plasmodesmata (PD), and is usually mediated by one or more virus-encoded movement proteins (MP) which interact with multiple cellular factors, among them protein kinases that usually have negative effects on MP function and virus movement. In this study, we report physical and functional interaction between MP of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the paradigm of PD-moving proteins, and a receptor-like kinase BAM1 from Arabidopsis and its homolog from Nicotiana benthamiana. The interacting proteins accumulated in the PD regions, colocalizing with a PD marker. Reversed genetics experiments, using BAM1 gain-of-function and loss-of-function plants, indicated that BAM1 is required for efficient spread and accumulation the virus during initial stages of infection of both plant species by TMV. Furthermore, BAM1 was also required for the efficient cell-to-cell movement of TMV MP, suggesting that BAM1 interacts with TMV MP to support early movement of the virus. Interestingly, this role of BAM1 in viral movement did not require its protein kinase activity. Thus, we propose that association of BAM1 with TMV MP at PD facilitates the MP transport through PD, which, in turn, enhances the spread of the viral infection.",eng,2021,04,30,2021,5,2,epublish,Arabidopsis|Arabidopsis Proteins|Plant Proteins|Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Viral Proteins|Virus Replication,D017360|D029681|D010940|D017346|D014026|D014027|D014764|D014779,

This supports the notion that, in addition to their role in translation of cellular mRNAs, eIF4E isoforms are also essential for the potyvirus cycle. CERES is a plant eIF4E- and eIF(iso)4E-binding protein that, through its binding to the eIF4Es, modulates translation initiation; however, its possible role in potyvirus resistance is unknown. In this article, we analyse if the ectopic expression of AtCERES is able to interfere with turnip mosaic virus replication in plants. Our results demonstrate that, during infection, the ectopic expression of CERES in Nicotiana benthamiana promotes the development of a mosaic phenotype when it is accumulated to moderate levels, but induces veinal necrosis when it is accumulated to higher levels. This necrotic process resembles a hypersensitive response (HR)-like response that occurs with different HR hallmarks. Remarkably, Arabidopsis plants inoculated with a virus clone that promotes high expression of CERES do not show signs of infection. These final phenotypical outcomes are independent of the capacity of CERES to bind to eIF4E.

TMV coat protein assembly is modulated by intersubunit carboxylate groups whose electrostatic repulsion limits the assembly of virus rods without incorporating genomic RNA. To engineer assembly control into this system, we reprogrammed intersubunit carboxylate interactions to produce self-assembling coat proteins in the absence of RNA and in response to unique pH and ionic environmental conditions. Specifically, engineering a charge attraction at the intersubunit E50-D77 carboxylate group through a D77K substitution stabilized the coat proteins assembly into virus-like rods. In contrast, the reciprocal E50K modification alone did not confer virus-like rod assembly. However, a combination of R46G/E50K/E97G substitutions enabled virus-like rod assembly. Interestingly, the D77K substitution displays a unique pH-dependent assembly-disassembly profile, while the R46G/E50K/E97G substitutions confer a novel salt concentration dependency for assembly control.

The SHE1 protein was localized in the nucleus, but in the presence of the CMV 1a protein was partitioned between the nucleus and the tonoplast membrane. SHE1 expression was induced by infection of tobacco with four tested viruses: CMV, tobacco mosaic virus, potato virus X and potato virus Y. Transgenic tobacco expressing the CMV 1a protein showed constitutive expression of SHE1, indicating that the CMV 1a protein may be responsible for its induction. However, previously, such plants also were shown to have less resistance to local and systemic movement of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) expressing the green fluorescent protein, suggesting that the CMV 1a protein may act to prevent the function of the SHE1 protein. SHE1 is a member of the AP2/ERF class of transcription factors and is conserved in sequence in several Nicotiana species, although two clades of SHE1 could be discerned, including both different Nicotiana species and cultivars of tobacco, varying by the presence of particular insertions or deletions.",eng,2021,04,01,2021,4,20,ppublish,,,CMV 1a localization|CMV 1a:SHE1 colocalization|SHE1|cucumber mosaic virus 1a protein|transcription factor

Rep binds to specific repeated DNA motifs (""iterons""), which are major determinants of virus-specific replication. The particular amino acid (aa) residues that determine the preference of a geminivirus Rep for specific iterons (i.e., the trans-acting replication ""specificity determinants"", or SPDs) are largely unknown, but diverse lines of evidence indicate that most of them are closely associated with the so-called RCR motif I (FLTYP), located in the first 12-19 aa residues of the protein. In this work, we characterized two strains of a novel begomovirus, rhynchosia golden mosaic Sinaloa virus (RhGMSV), that were incompatible in replication in pseudorecombination experiments. Systematic comparisons of the Rep proteins of both RhGMSV strains in the DNA-binding domain allowed the aa residues at positions 71 and 74 to be identified as the residues most likely to be responsible for differences in replication specificity. Residue 71 is part of the Î²-5 strand structural element, which was predicted in previous studies to contain Rep SPDs. Since the Rep proteins encoded by both RhGMSV strains are identical in their first 24 aa residues, where other studies have mapped potential SPDs, this is the first study lending direct support to the notion that geminivirus Rep proteins contain separate SPDs in their N-terminal domain.",eng,2021,04,14,2021,4,15,ppublish,"Amino Acid Sequence|Begomovirus|Cloning, Molecular|Fabaceae|Genome, Viral|Phylogeny|Plant Leaves|Protein Conformation|Reassortant Viruses|Tobacco|Viral Proteins|Virus Replication",D000595|D053839|D003001|D007887|D016679|D010802|D018515|D011487|D016865|D014026|D014764|D014779,

Salicylic acid (SA), a well-characterized hormone responsible for immune responses against virus, is activated through different transcription factors including TGA and WRKY. In tobamoviruses, evidence suggests that capsid protein (CP) is required for long-distance movement, although its precise role has not been fully characterized yet. Previously, we showed that the CP of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)-Cg negatively modulates the SA-mediated defense. In this study, we analyzed the impact of SA-defense mechanism on the long-distance transport of a truncated version of TMV (TMV âCP virus) that cannot move to systemic tissues. The study showed that the negative modulation of NPR1 and TGA10 factors allows the long-distance transport of TMV âCP virus. Moreover, we observed that the stabilization of DELLA proteins promotes TMV âCP systemic movement. We also characterized a group of genes, part of a network modulated by CP, involved in TMV âCP long-distance transport. Altogether, our results indicate that CP-mediated downregulation of SA signaling pathway is required for the virus systemic movement, and this role of CP may be linked to its ability to stabilize DELLA proteins.",eng,2021,05,18,2021,4,11,ppublish,Capsid Proteins|Down-Regulation|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Movement|Plant Diseases|Plant Immunity|Plant Proteins|Salicylic Acid|Signal Transduction|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D036022|D015536|D054884|D009068|D010935|D057865|D010940|D020156|D015398|D014026|D014027,DELLA protein|SA|Tobamovirus|coat protein|plants immunity|systemic movement

Further analyses showed that vsiRNA1 could modulate the expression of a wheat thioredoxin-like gene (TaAAED1), which encodes a negative regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the chloroplast. The function of TaAAED1 in ROS scavenging could be suppressed by vsiRNA1 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, transgenic expression of amiRNA1 in wheat resulted in broad-spectrum disease resistance to Chinese wheat mosaic virus, Barley stripe mosaic virus, and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici infection, suggesting that vsiRNA1 is involved in wheat immunity via ROS signaling.

First, production of a Cas9 (HcoCas9) protein from a binary plasmid increased when co-expressed in presence of suppressors of gene silencing, such as the TMV 126-kDa replicase or the Tomato bushy stunt virus P19 protein. Such suppressor-generated elevated levels of Cas9 expression translated to efficient gene editing mediated by TRBO-G-3'gGFP expressing GFP and also a single guide RNA targeting the mgfp5 gene in the Nicotiana benthamiana GFP-expressing line 16c. Furthermore, HcoCas9 encoding RNA, a large cargo insert of 4.2Â kb, was expressed from TRBO-HcoCas9 to yield Cas9 protein again at higher levels upon co-expression with P19. Likewise, co-delivery of TRBO-HcoCas9 and TRBO-G-3'gGFP in the presence of P19 also resulted in elevated levels percentages of indels (insertions and deletions). These data also revealed an age-related phenomenon in plants whereby the RNA suppressor P19 had more of an effect in older plants. Lastly, we used a single TRBO vector to express both Cas9 and a sgRNA. Taken together, we suggest that viral RNA suppressors could be used for further optimization of single viral vector delivery of CRISPR gene editing parts.",eng,2021,03,24,2021,3,26,epublish,"CRISPR-Associated Protein 9|CRISPR-Cas Systems|Gene Editing|Gene Expression|Gene Order|Gene Silencing|Gene Transfer Techniques|Genetic Engineering|Genetic Vectors|Plants, Genetically Modified|Plasmids|RNA Interference|RNA, Guide|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Viral Proteins",D000076987|D064113|D000072669|D015870|D023061|D020868|D018014|D005818|D005822|D030821|D010957|D034622|D017394|D014027|D014764,

In June 2018, a leaf sample of B. suaveolens that showed virus-like symptoms including chlorotic spots, yellowing and mottle on leaves was collected from a greenhouse in Seongnam, South Korea for disease diagnosis (Supplementary Figure S1a, b). Disease incidence in the greenhouse was greater than 80% for about 2,000 B. suaveolens plants. To identify a causal virus, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to analyze symptomatic leaf samples using leaf dips and thin section methods. Filamentous virus particles and pinwheel structures were observed, indicating the presence of a potyvirus (Supplementary Figure S1c, d). To confirm the TEM results, a symptomatic leaf sample was further analyzed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using species-specific detection primers for three potyviruses that infect Brugmansia spp.: Colombian datura virus (CDV), Brugmansia mosaic virus (BruMV), and Brugmansia suaveolens mottle virus (BsMoV) (Lucinda et al, 2008; Park et al., 2014; Verma et al., 2014). The sample was positive only for CDV. CDV is transmitted by aphids in a nonpersistent manner and mechanical inoculation and can infect plants in the Solanaceae family including tomato and tobacco (Kahn and Bartels 1968; Schubert et al. 2006; Verhoeven et al. 1996) and has been designated a quarantine virus in Korea. Additional analysis of 13 symptomatic B. suaveolens plants from the infected greenhouse found that all samples except one were infected with CDV. To isolate CDV from B. suaveolens, leaf extracts from symptomatic samples were mechanically inoculated on an assay host, Nicotiana tabacum cv. BY via three single-lesion passages followed by propagation in N. benthamiana. For the bioassay of the CDV isolate (CDV-AT-Kr), sap from infected N. benthamiana was mechanically inoculated on 31 indicator plants, including B. suaveolens (Supplementary Table S2). CDV-AT-Kr induced chlorotic local lesions, necrotic local lesions, mottle, and/or mosaic systemically in 10 Nicotiana spp., and mottle and yellowing in tomato. On inoculated B. suaveolens, te mild mottle symptom was reproduced. No symptoms were observed in pepper or Datura stramonium. These results were confirmed by RT-PCR. To characterize CDV-AT-Kr genetically, the complete genome sequence of CDV-AT-Kr was obtained by RT-PCR using specific primers (Supplementary Table S3) and deposited in GenBank (accession no. MW075268). The CDV-AT-Kr RNA consists of 9,620 nt, encoding a polyprotein of 3,076 aa. BLASTn analysis showed that CDV-AT had maximum nucleotide identities of 98.9% at the complete genome level with a CDV isolate (accession no. JQ801448) from N. tabacum in the UK. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CDV infection in B. suaveolens in Korea and the second report in the world of the complete genome sequence. As B. suaveolens is cultivated by vegetative propagation, production and maintenance of virus-free, healthy B. suaveolens is needed. In addition, as new CDV hosts have been repeatedly reported (Pacifico et al., 2016; Salamon et al., 2015; Tomitaka et al., 2014; Verma et al., 2014), we are monitoring nationwide occurrence to prevent the spread of the virus to other crops.",eng,2021,03,09,2021,3,16,aheadofprint,,,<italic>Brugmansia suaveolens</italic>|<italic>Colombian datura virus</italic>|potyvirus

In our study, we analysed a potential mechanism via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and found that the abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthetic pathway and Î²-1,3-glucanase, a callose-degrading enzyme, might play an important role in PDMP-induced priming of resistance to TMV. To test our hypothesis, we successfully generated a Nicotiana benthamiana ABA biosynthesis mutant and evaluated the role of the ABA pathway in PDMP-induced callose deposition during resistance to TMV infection. Our results suggested that PDMP can induce callose priming to defend against TMV movement. PDMP inhibited TMV movement by increasing callose deposition around plasmodesmata, but this phenomenon did not occur in the ABA biosynthesis mutant; moreover, these effects of PDMP on callose deposition could be rescued by treatment with exogenous ABA. Our results suggested that callose deposition around plasmodesmata in wild-type plants is mainly responsible for the restriction of TMV movement during the PDMP-induced defensive response to TMV infection, and that ABA biosynthesis apparently plays a crucial role in PDMP-induced callose priming for enhancing defence against TMV.",eng,,,,2021,3,10,ppublish,"Glucans|Penicillium chrysogenum|Peptides|Plant Diseases|Plant Extracts|Plants, Genetically Modified|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D005936|D010408|D010455|D010935|D010936|D030821|D014026|D014027,"

Quantitative data of 3D ultrastructural changes were then extracted from the cytosol and organelles by image analysis. While TMV induced the accumulation of an average of 40 virus inclusion bodies in the cytosol, which covered about 13% of the cell volume, ZYMV caused the accumulation of an average of 1752 cylindrical inclusions in the cytosol, which covered about 2.7% of the total volume of the cell. TMV infection significantly decreased the number and size of mitochondria (- 49 and - 20%) and peroxisomes (- 62 and - 28%) of the reconstructed cell.

Host protein kinases often regulate virus infectivity and pathogenicity by phosphorylating viral proteins. The Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) Î³b protein plays versatile roles in virus infection and the coevolutionary arms race between plant defense and viral counter-defense. Here, we identified that the autophosphorylated cytosolic serine/threonine/tyrosine (STY) protein kinase 46 of Nicotiana benthamiana (NbSTY46) phosphorylates and directly interacts with the basic motif domain (aa 19-47) of Î³b in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of wild-type NbSTY46, either transiently or transgenically, suppresses BSMV replication and ameliorates viral symptoms, whereas silencing of NbSTY46 leads to increased viral replication and exacerbated symptom. Moreover, the antiviral role of NbSTY46 requires its kinase activity, as the NbSTY46T436A mutant, lacking kinase activity, not only loses the ability to phosphorylate and interact with Î³b but also fails to impair BSMV infection when expressed in plants. NbSTY46 could also inhibit the replication of Lychnis ringspot virus, another chloroplast-replicating hordeivirus.

After pre-processing and Ribo-Zero rRNA removal, a cDNA library was prepared (Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit) and sequenced (Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system: Macrogen Inc. Korea). De novo assembly of 88,222,684 HTS reads with Trinity software (r20140717) yielded 146,269 contigs of 201-28,442 bp, which were screened against the NCBI viral genome database by BLASTn. Contigs from cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), melon necrotic spot virus (MNSV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) were identified, all previously reported in Korea. Two contigs (8,539 and 8,040 bp) with 99.9% sequence identity to distinct cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) isolates (JN641883, RNA1, Taiwan; MH819191, RNA2, China) were also identified. The ten sequences most closely related to each RNA of the Korean isolate (â¥99% coverage, â¥99.6% nt identity) were from Japan, China, Taiwan, or Israel. CCYV presence was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using newly designed specific primers, RdRp-F/RdRp-R (5'-ACCGAACACTTGGCTATCCAA-3'/5'-CTTAATGCCGCGTATGAACTCA-3') span style=""font-family:'Times New Roman'; letter-spacing:-0.5pt"">and HSP-F/HSP-R (5'-TGAACGACACTGAGTTCATTCCTA-3'/5'-CGCCAAGATCGTACATGAGGAA-3'), against RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; RNA1) and the heat shock protein 70 homolog (HSP70h; RNA2). Symptomatic samples yielded products of expected sizes (RdRp,450 bp; HSP70h, 510 bp) while asymptomatic samples did not. The amplicons were cloned, and two clones of each were sequenced (BIONEER, Korea; GenBank acc. nos. LC592226 and LC592227) showing 100% and 99.2% nt identity with RdRp and HSP70h genes of Chinese CCYV isolate SD (MH819190 and MH819191, respectively) and other Asian isolates. Primers specific for CMV, WMV, beet pseudo-yellows virus (BPYV) (Okuda et al., 2007), TMV (Kim et al., 2018), MNSV (F/R, 5'-ATCTCGCATTTGGCATTACTC-3'/5'-ATTTGTAGAGATGCCAACGTA-3'), cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV; Zeng et al., 2011) and cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV; F/R, 5'-CGGTCTATTGTCTGCAGTACCA-3'/5'- GTAGAGGATCTTGAATTGGTCCTCA-3') were also used. None of these viruses were detected in the symptomatic samples, but both asymptomatic plants were positive for CMV and WMV, and one also for MNSV. In June and September 2020, muskmelon and oriental melon (Cucumis melo L. var. makuwa) plants with yellowing disease (incidence 80-90%) and whiteflies were observed in all investigated plastic houses of one muskmelon and one oriental melon farm in Gyeonggi and Jeolla provinces. Symptomatic samples (14 muskmelon; 6 oriental melon) were collected and RT-PCR tested as above; 19/20 samples were positive for CCYV, but none for the other viruses. The oriental melon sequence (LC592895, LC592230) showed 99.7% and 100% nt identity with the RdRp and HSP70h genes of Chinese isolate SD, respectively. CCYV was first reported in Japan (Okuda et al., 2010), Taiwan, and China (Huang et al., 2010; Gu et al., 2011); to our knowledge, this is the first report of CCYV infecting muskmelon and oriental melon in Korea.

Seven genes were identified, of which one of the members was already shown to interact with plant virus proteins in a previous study. A phylogenetic and tissue-specific expression analysis, including laser-dissected phloem, by qRT-PCRs was performed and the sub-cellular localization of individual AtG3BP::EYFP fluorescent fusion proteins expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells was observed. Individual AtG3BP-protein interactions in planta were studied using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation approach in combination with confocal imaging in living cells. In addition, the early and late induction of G3BP-like expression upon Turnip mosaic virus infection was investigated by RNAseq and qRT-PCR. The results showed a high divergence of transcription frequency in the different plant tissues, promiscuous protein-protein interaction within the G3BP-like gene family, and a general induction by a viral infection with TuMV in A. thaliana.

This study deals with developing novel synthetic promoters derived from Rice Tungro Bacilliform Virus (RTBV) and Mirabilis Mosaic Virus (MMV). Despite numerous availability, there is a severe scarcity of promoters universally suitable for monocot and dicot plants. Here, eight chimeric promoter constructs were synthesized as gBlocks gene fragments through domain swapping and hybridization by incorporating important domains of previously characterized RTBV and MMV promoters. The developed promoter constructs were assessed for transient GUS expression in tobacco protoplast (Xanthi Brad) and agro-infiltrated tobacco, petunia, rice and pearl millet. Protoplast expression analysis showed that two promoter constructs, namely pUPMA-RP1-MP1GUS and pUPMA-RP4-MP1GUS exhibited 3.56 and 2.5 times higher activities than that of the CaMV35S promoter. We had observed the similar type of expression patterns of these promoters in agroinfiltration-based transient studies. RP1-MP1 and RP4-MP1 promoters exhibited 1.87- and 1.68-fold increase expression in transgenic tobacco plants; while, a 1.95-fold increase was found in RP1-MP1 transgenic rice plants when compared their activities with CaMV35S promoter. Furthermore, on evaluating these promoter constructs for their expression in the bacterial system, pUPMA-RP1-MP1GFP was found to have the highest GFP expression. Moreover, the promoter construct was also evaluated for its capacity to express the HMP3 gene. Biobeads of encapsulated bacterial cells expressing HMP3 gene under control of the pUPMA-RP4-MP1 promoter were found to reduce 72.9% copper and 29.2% zinc concentration from wastewater.

Development of acceptable genetic resistance has been difficult due to a strong environmental component and many major and minor QTLs. Resistance genes (R-genes) are an important component of plant immune system and have been identified in peanut. Association of specific R-genes to leaf spot resistance will provide molecular targets for marker-assisted breeding strategies. In this study, advanced breeding lines from different pedigrees were evaluated for leaf spot resistance and 76 candidate R-genes expression study was applied to susceptible and resistant lines. Thirty-six R-genes were differentially expressed and significantly correlated with resistant lines, of which a majority are receptor like kinases (RLKs) and receptor like proteins (RLPs) that sense the presence of pathogen at the cell surface and initiate protection response. The largest group was receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) VII that are involved in pattern-triggered kinase signaling resulting in the production reactive oxygen species (ROS). Four R-genes were homologous to TMV resistant protein N which has shown to confer resistance against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). When mapped to peanut genomes, 36 R-genes were represented in most chromosomes except for A09 and B09. Low levels of gene-expression in resistant lines suggest expression is tightly controlled to balance the cost of R-gene expression to plant productively.

In this study, we developed pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) (family Alphaflexiviridae; genus Potexvirus) into a vector for heterologous protein expression in plants. PepMV was initially cloned in a step-wise manner, fully sequenced and the full-length infectious clone was tested for infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana. Initial infectious clones resulted in poor replication of PepMV and lack of systemic movement. Mutations in the viral sequence affected systemic infection. Two suspected mutations were altered to restore systemic infectivity. PepMV infection was apparent as early as 4 days post agroinfiltration (dpa) inoculation in N. benthamiana. A multiple cloning site was inserted into the PepMV genome for introduction and expression of foreign genes. Several modifications to the wild-type vector were made, such as a replacing the native subgenomic promoter (SGP) with a heterologous SGP, and introduction of translational enhancers and terminators, to improve heterologous expression of the foreign gene-of-interest. GFP was used as a reporter for monitoring virus infection and protein production. Strong GFP expression was observed as early as 4 dpa with a translational enhancer. The PepMV-based vector produces rapid expression of the foreign gene in comparison to two other potexvirus-based vectors. GFP production was monitored over time and optimal protein production was recorded between 5 and 7 dpa. GFP protein levels reached up to 4% and decreased to 0.5% total soluble protein at 7 and 14 dpa, respectively.

Seventy-eight cassava accessions obtained from different locations of Ebonyi State were phenotypically scored, using scales 1-5 depending on CMD symptomatic expressions, followed by multiplex-PCR and sequencing for validation. 11% of cassava accessions cultivated in Afikpo were resistant (RE) to ACMV compared to 8% of moderately-resistant (MR) accessions in Izzi and 55% of tolerant (TO) ACMV accessions in Ebonyi. 100% of cassava accessions in Onicha and 66% in Afikpo South were susceptible (SU) and highly susceptible (HS) to ACMV, respectively. With multiplex-PCR, 97.4% (ACMV) and 2.6% (EACMV) were positive. Dunn's multiple comparison tests of CMD mean incidence demonstrated differences (Pâ<â0.05), except between RE and MR, and TO and MR.

The results showed that the chimeric viruses (TMV-CGCP or TMV-PMCP) induce stunting and necrotic symptoms in tobacco plants. We analyzed the transcriptomic changes in tobacco plants after infection of TMV and its chimeras using a high-throughput RNA sequencing approach and found that infection of the chimeric TMV induced significant up-regulation of host defence responsive genes together with salicylic (SA) or abscisic acid (ABA) responsive genes, but down-regulation of auxin (Aux) responsive genes. We further confirmed the increase in the levels of SA and ABA, together with the reduced levels of Aux after infection of chimeric TMV in tobacco plants.

Glucosylceramides (GlcCer) are classified as neutral glycosphingolipids. GlcCer were isolated and purified from Fusarium oxysporum mycelium. F. oxysporum is a plant pathogenic fungus, abundant in soil and causing severe losses in economically important crops such as corn, tobacco, banana, cotton and passion fruit. In this study we evaluate the capacity of GlcCer in inducing resistance in N. tabacum cv Xanthi plants against Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Spraying tobacco plants with GlcCer before virus infection reduced the incidence of necrotic lesions caused by TMV. In addition, plants already infected with the virus showed a reduction in hypersensitive response (HR) lesions after GlcCer treatment, suggesting an antiviral effect of GlcCer. Our investigations showed that GlcCer stimulates the early accumulation of H2O2 and superoxide radicals. In addition, the expression of PR-1 (pathogenesis-related 1, with suggested antifungal action), PR-2 (Î²-1,3-glucanase), PR-3 (Chitinase), PR-5 (Osmotin), PAL (Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), LOX (Lipoxygenase) and POX (Peroxidase) genes was highly induced after treatment of tobacco plants with GlcCer and induction levels remained high throughout a period of 6 to 120 hours.

Because viral processes occur in IBs, understanding the mechanisms by which they are formed is crucial. FL-P6 expressed in N. benthamiana leaves formed IBs of a variety of shapes and sizes. Small IBs were dynamic, undergoing fusion/dissociation events. Co-expression of actin-binding polypeptides with FL-P6 altered IB size distribution and inhibited movement. This suggests that IB movement is required for fusion and growth. A P6 deletion mutant was discovered that formed a single large IB per cell, which suggests it exhibited altered fusion/dissociation dynamics. Myosin-inhibiting drugs did not affect small IB movement, while those inhibiting actin polymerization did. Large IBs colocalized with components of the aggresome pathway, while small ones generally did not.

RNAi-mediated RNA silencing is a well-known antiviral immune mechanism. At elevated temperatures, RNAi-mediated antiviral resistance was induced and virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) were dramatically increased. Through sRNA-sequencing (sRNA-Seq) analysis, we revealed that vsiRNAs derived from TMV-P0 were greatly increased. Intriguingly, virus-infected plants could select the temperature-specific vsiRNAs for antiviral resistance from the amplified vsiRNAs at elevated temperatures.

This advances the ability to measure charge on nanometric samples. Experimental atomic force microscope (AFM) force-distance curves are collected under aqueous conditions with controlled pH and ion concentration. A mathematical model that considers a polarizable dielectric tip immersed in an electrolyte is used to obtain charge density from the AFM measurements. Interactions between the tip and the sample are modeled using theory that includes monopolar electrostatic interactions, dipolar interactions, screening from both the dielectric nature of ambient water and solvated ions as described by the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and hard-core repulsion. It is found that the tip charge density changes on a timescale of hours requiring recalibration of the tip for experiments lasting more than an hour. As an example of how a charge-calibrated tip may be used, the surface charge densities on 20 individual carboxylate-modified polystyrene (PS) beads are measured. The average of these AFM-measured bead charge densities is compared with the value obtained from conventional titration combined with electron microscopy. The two values are found to agree within 20%. While the comparison demonstrates similarity of the two charge measurements, hypotheses are put forward as to why the two techniques might be expected not to provide identical mean charge densities. The considerations used to build these hypotheses thus underscore the relevance of the method performed here if charge information is required on individual nanoparticles.",eng,2020,11,06,2020,11,7,ppublish,,,

Sw.) is a vigorous perennial and climbing cucurbits, native to Mesoamerica, and cultivated for alimentary purposes in the American continent, Australia, New Zealand, South Europe, Asia and Africa. During spring 2019, some chayote plants showing bright yellow vein banding rings and lines were observed in a private garden in South Italy (Campania region). Symptoms coalesced in some leaves, covering almost the whole foliar area. Double-stranded RNAs were extracted from symptomatic leaves of a single chayote plant and reverse-transcribed, randomly amplified, and submitted to Illumina sequencing (Marais et al., 2018). Reads were assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench 11.1 (http://www.clcbio.com). Contigs were then annotated by Blastn and Blastx comparison with the Genbank database, which allowed the identification of eight contigs of between 380 and 980 nucleotides sharing significant identity with alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) genomic RNAs. No other viral contigs were identified. Mapping of reads on AMV genomic RNAs identified 4,209 AMV reads (1.26% of total reads) and allowed the scaffolding of the contigs into three scaffolds corresponding to the three AMV genomic RNAs. To complete the sequence of the AMV chayote isolate genome (named See-1), primers were designed from the contig sequences and used to amplify RACE PCR products spanning the 5' and 3' terminal regions of the three genomic RNAs using the SMARTerâ¢ RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, China). All amplicons were cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, USA) and sequenced (three clones for each amplicon) by Microsynth Seqlab (Microsynth AG, Switzerland). Finally, the complete genomic sequences of the three RNAs were assembled by MacVector 17.5 (MacVector Inc., USA). The RNA1, RNA2 and RNA3 of See-1 are 3,643, 2,593 and 2,037 nt respectively (GenBank accession Nos. MT093209 to MT093211), and share the highest nt sequence identity with the RNA1 and RNA3 of AMV isolate (HZ) from tobacco (99.5% for RNA1, HQ316635; 98.7% for RNA3, HQ316637) and with the RNA2 of isolate AMV-Gym from Gynostemma pentaphyllum (98.1%, MH332898), both from China. AMV isolate See-1 was classified as belonging to subgroup I based on the presence of a BamH I and two AvaII sites in the CP ORF (Parrella et al., 2000). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, using primers targeting the CP gene (Parrella et al., 2000), confirmed AMV infection in three symptomatic cayote plants including that used for Illumina sequencing, with 100% of nt sequence identity of amplicons. Three plants each of Chenopodium amaranticolor, Nicotiana benthamiana and Solanum lycopersicon were mechanically inoculated with sap from isolate See-1 infected plant, leading to the appearance of typical AMV symptoms in all three hosts ten days post-inoculation (Jaspars & Bos, 1980). This note describes the first detection of AMV in cayote in Italy and, to the best of our knowledge, in the world. In some areas of Southern Italy, climatic conditions are favorable enough to allow chayote development in the wild. Further studies would be desirable to determine the distribution and incidence of AMV in chayote and to understand the possibility that this species may play a role in AMV epidemiology, representing a threat to other susceptible crops.",eng,2020,11,02,2020,11,3,aheadofprint,,,Causal Agent|Epidemiology|Sechium edule|Subject Areas|Viruses and viroids|alfalfa mosaic virus|disease development and spread

This article reviews the characteristics of TMV and related viruses, and their virus-like particle (VLP) derivatives, and how these may be manipulated to extend their use and function. A focus of recent efforts has been on greater understanding and control of the self-assembly processes that drive biotemplate formation. How these features have been exploited in engineering applications such as, sensing, catalysis, and energy storage are briefly outlined. While control of VLP surface features is well-established, fewer tools exist to control VLP self-assembly, which limits efforts to control template uniformity and synthesis of certain templated nanomaterials.

B,Highly sensitive serological approaches for Pepino mosaic virus detection.,10.1631/jzus.B2000255,"Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) causes severe disease in tomato and other Solanaceous crops around globe. To effectively study and manage this viral disease, researchers need new, sensitive, and high-throughput approaches for viral detection. In this study, we purified PepMV particles from the infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants and used virions to immunize BALB/c mice to prepare hybridomas secreting anti-PepMV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A panel of highly specific and sensitive murine mAbs (15B2, 8H6, 23D11, 20D9, 3A6, and 8E3) could be produced through cell fusion, antibody selection, and cell cloning. Using the mAbs as the detection antibodies, we established double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA), Dot-ELISA, and Tissue print-ELISA for detecting PepMV infection in tomato plants. Resulting data on sensitivity analysis assays showed that both DAS-ELISA and Dot-ELISA can efficiently monitor the virus in PepMV-infected tissue crude extracts when diluted at 1:1 310 720 and 1:20 480 (weight/volume ratio (w/v), g/mL), respectively. Among the three methods developed, the Tissue print-ELISA was found to be the most practical detection technique. Survey results from field samples by the established serological approaches were verified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and DNA sequencing, demonstrating all three serological methods are reliable and effective for monitoring PepMV.

AGO1 strongly enhanced potato virus A (PVA) particle production and benefited the infection when supplied in excess. We subsequently identified the potyviral silencing suppressor, helper-component protease (HCPro), as the recruiter of host AGO1. After the identification of a conserved AGO1-binding GW/WG motif in potyviral HCPros, we used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a tryptophan-to-alanine change into the HCPro (HCProAG) of PVA (PVAAG) and turnip mosaic virus (TuMVAG). AGO1 co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation with PVA HCPro was significantly reduced by the mutation suggesting the interaction was compromised. Although the mutation did not interfere with HCPro's complementation or silencing suppression capacity, it nevertheless impaired virus particle accumulation and the systemic spread of both PVA and TuMV. Furthermore, we found that the HCPro-AGO1 interaction was important for AGO1's association with the PVA coat protein. The coat protein was also more stable in wild type PVA infection than in PVAAG infection. Based on these findings we suggest that potyviral HCPro recruits host AGO1 through its WG motif and engages AGO1 in the production of stable virus particles, which are required for an efficient systemic infection.",eng,2020,10,08,2020,10,9,epublish,Mutation|Plant Diseases|Plant Proteins|Potyvirus|RNA Interference|Tobacco|Viral Proteins,D009154|D010935|D010940|D017800|D034622|D014026|D014764,

The complementation effect is usually studied by observing virus infection after co-infection or super-inoculation of the helper virus. We herein demonstrate the utility of functionally deficient viral vectors as tools to determine the contribution of individual viral genes to plant viral transport complementation. Two functionally deficient viral vectors were engineered that derive from foxtail mosaic potexvirus and sunn-hemp mosaic tobamovirus, namely FECT (FoMV Eliminate CP and TGB, (Liu and Kearney, 2010)) and SHEC (SHMV Eliminate CP gene, (Liu and Kearney, 2010)), respectively. FECT had all the ORFs removed except for the replicase and thus is defective for both long-distance and cell-to-cell movement. SHEC lacked only the coat protein ORF and retained the movement protein (MP) and is functional for cell-to-cell movement. When FECT and SHEC vectors were inoculated with the silencing suppressor p19 in different zones of the same leaf, FECT was enabled to express its reporter gene beyond the original inoculation zone. When FECT, SHEC, and p19 were individually inoculated in separate zones, both FECT and SHEC reporter gene expression was observed within the p19 zone, distant from the original virus inoculation points. These observations indicate that SHEC movement protein could create a trafficking network to allow viral RNAs of FECT and SHEC and p19/p19 transcript to move from cell to cell. This system provides a tool to visually monitor the movement of viruses and silencing suppressors as well as to identify the effects of individual viral components on virus movement.",eng,2020,09,30,2020,10,4,ppublish,"Genes, Viral|Potexvirus|RNA, Viral|Tobacco|Tobamovirus",D005814|D017863|D012367|D014026|D017898,Potexvirus|Tobamovirus|Virus complementation|Virus movement|p19 silencing suppressor

A total of 0.5% of the tomato plants in the greenhouse (1,38 ha) showed these symptoms. The presence of tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) was suspected. A total of 5 symptomatic and 2 symptomless leaf samples were collected and analyzed by double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA with antibodies for ToBRFV, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) (Loewe Biochemica, Germany). Symptomatic samples tested positive by DAS-ELISA only for ToBRFV. Therefore, one sample was selected and analyzed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with specific primers ToBRFV-F5722/ToBRFV-R6179 for ToBRFV (Panno et al. 2019a) which amplified a 458 bp fragment of the coat protein gene. The sequence obtained by Sanger sequencing from the amplicon showed 99.7% nt identity with ToBRFV isolate from United Kingdom (Acc. No. MN182533) and was deposited in the GenBank database under the accession number MT211630. Further surveys were performed in Vicar and El Egido (AlmerÃ­a, Spain) on plants showing viral-like symptoms. A total of 50 tomato and two pepper leaf samples from 28 greenhouses were collected and analyzed by DAS-ELISA for ToBRFV, TMV, ToMV, pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) , tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) with respective antibodies (Loewe Biochemica, Germany). Five tomato plants (four from Vicar and one from El Ejido) tested positive for ToBRFV. PepMV, ToMV and TYLCV were also detected in one, three and five tomato plants, respectively. The ELISA positive results for ToBRFV were confirmed by end point RT-PCR with primer pairs ToBRFV-F5722/ToBRFV-R6179 and ToBRFV-F/ToBRFV-R (Alkouni et al., 2019) and by real-time RT-PCR with Taqman probe ToB-probe and specific primers ToB5520F/ToB5598R (Panno et al., 2019b). Tomato seeds used for plantation in these greenhouses were also analyzed, but ToBRFV was not detected. Eradication measures have been undertaken to prevent the virus spread and to control this outbreak. Official seed analysis by DAS-ELISA and real time RT-PCR (ISF, 2019) are being conducted on the tomato and pepper imported seeds to prevent the appearance of new sources of ToBRFV inoculum in Spain.

Reducing the expression of NbRabF1 in N. benthamiana by virus-induced gene silencing decreased the accumulation of BaMV, and with smaller infection foci on inoculated leaves, but had no effect in protoplasts. Furthermore, transient expression of NbRabF1 increased the accumulation of BaMV in inoculated leaves. Thus, NbRabF1 may be involved in the cell-to-cell movement of BaMV. The potential acyl modification sites at the second and third amino acid positions of NbRabF1 were crucial for membrane targeting and BaMV accumulation. The localization of mutant forms of NbRabF1 with the GDP-bound (donor site) and GTP-bound (acceptor site) suggested that NbRabF1 might regulate vesicle trafficking between the Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. Furthermore, GTPase activity could also be involved in BaMV cell-to-cell movement. Overall, in this study, we identified a small GTPase, NbRabF1, from N. benthamiana that interacts with its activation protein NbRabGAP1 and regulates vesicle transport from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane.

Here, we demonstrate that a mild strain mutant of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV-43A) can protect Nicotiana benthamiana plants against infection by a challenger Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-Fny strain. The isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technique was used to investigate proteome of N. benthamiana plant during HSE. Our results indicated that in superinfected plants, the PSI and PSII proteins in the photosynthetic pathway increased in abundance, providing sufficient energy to plants for survival. The fatty acid synthesis-related proteins acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1-like and fatty acid synthase were decreased in abundance, affecting the formation of virus replication complex, which in turn reduced CMV replication and lessen hijacking of basic building blocks of RNA transcription and protein synthesis required for normal host functions. This is the first analyses of host proteins that are correlated to HSE between two unrelated plant viruses TMV-43A and CMV in N. benthamiana plants. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: CMV is one of the most studied host-virus interaction models in plants. It infects both monocot and dicot crop plants, causing significant economic losses. Superinfection exclusion (also known as cross protection) is one of the methods to combat virus infection. However, there is lack of proteome information of heterologous superinfection exclusion between two taxonomically unrelated plant viruses (such as between CMV and TMV). An iTRAQ-based quantitative approach was used to study proteomics of superinfection, where TMV-43A acts as a protector of N. benthamiana plants against its challenger CMV. Results showed that TMV-43A protects host plants and prevents plant death from CMV infection. This study provided insights into host responses involving multiple host pathways: photosynthesis, plant defence, carbon metabolism, translation and protein processing, fatty acid metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis. The findings provide a reference database for other viruses and increase our knowledge in host proteins that are correlated to superinfection.",eng,2020,08,25,2020,8,29,ppublish,Cucumovirus|Plant Diseases|Superinfection|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D017799|D010935|D015163|D014026|D014027,Cross protection|Cucumber mosaic virus|Photosynthesis|Quantitative proteomics|Tobacco mosaic virus

Proteomics, in conjunction with bioinformatic tools, represents the study involving the characterization of the protein content of the genome of a given biological system.

Although a wide range of techniques such as shotgun proteomics, MuDPIT, etc. are available for characterizing PII, those for characterizing RNA-protein interactions are infancy. Given the significance of the long noncoding RNAs (lnc-RNA) in plant biology, it is imperative to isolate and characterize the functionality of the host proteome interacting with RNA.

The TGB modules fall into two classes: hordei-like and potex-like. Although TGB-mediated viral movement has been extensively studied, determination of the constituents of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) movement complexes and the mechanisms underlying their involvement in vRNP-mediated movement are far from complete. In the current study, immunoprecipitation of TGB1 protein complexes formed during Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) infection revealed the presence of the Î³b protein in the products. Further experiments demonstrated that TGB1 interacts with Î³b in vitro and in vivo, and that Î³b-TGB1 localizes at the periphery of chloroplasts and plasmodesmata (PD). Subcellular localization analyses of the Î³b protein in Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells indicated that in addition to chloroplast localization, Î³b also targets the ER, actin filaments and PD at different stages of viral infection. By tracking Î³b localization during BSMV infection, we demonstrated that Î³b is required for efficient cell-to-cell movement. The N-terminus of Î³b interacts with the TGB1 ATPase/helicase domain and enhances ATPase activity of the domain. Inactivation of the TGB1 ATPase activity also significantly impaired PD targeting. In vitro translation together with co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) analyses revealed that TGB1-TGB3-TGB2 complex formation is enhanced by ATP hydrolysis. The Î³b protein positively regulates complex formation in the presence of ATP, suggesting that Î³b has a novel role in BSMV cell-to-cell movement by directly promoting TGB1 ATPase-mediated vRNP movement complex assembly. We further demonstrated that elimination of ATPase activity abrogates PD and actin targeting of Potato virus X (PVX) and Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) TGB1 proteins. These results expand our understanding of the multifunctional roles of Î³b and provide new insight into the functions of TGB1 ATPase domains in the movement of TGB-encoding viruses.",eng,2020,07,30,2020,7,31,epublish,Adenosine Triphosphatases|Plant Viral Movement Proteins|Plant Viruses|Potexvirus|RNA-Binding Proteins|Ribonucleoproteins|Tobacco|Viral Nonstructural Proteins|Virus Assembly,D000251|D053830|D010942|D017863|D016601|D012261|D014026|D017361|D019065,

However, the mechanism by which Î±-MMC increases plant resistance to viral infections remains unclear. To study the effect of Î±-MMC on plant viral defence and how Î±-MMC increases plant resistance to viruses, recombinant DNA and transgenic technologies were employed to investigate the role of Î±-MMC in Nicotiana benthamiana resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection. Treatment with Î±-MMC produced through DNA recombinant technology or overexpression of Î±-MMC mediated by transgenic technology alleviated TMV-induced oxidative damage and reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during TMV-green fluorescent protein infection of N.Â benthamiana. There was a significant decrease in TMV replication in the upper leaves following local Î±-MMC treatment and in Î±-MMC-overexpressing plants relative to control plants. These results suggest that application or overexpression of Î±-MMC in N.Â benthamiana increases resistance to TMV infection. Finally, our results showed that overexpression of Î±-MMC up-regulated the expression of ROS scavenging-related genes. Î±-MMC confers resistance to TMV infection by means of modulating ROS homeostasis through controlling the expression of antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes. Overall, our study revealed a new crosstalk mechanism between Î±-MMC and ROS during resistance to viral infection and provides a framework to understand the molecular mechanisms of Î±-MMC in plant defence against viral pathogens.",eng,2020,07,26,2020,7,28,ppublish,"Disease Resistance|Gene Expression|Plant Diseases|Plants, Genetically Modified|Reactive Oxygen Species|Ribosome Inactivating Proteins|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D060467|D015870|D010935|D030821|D017382|D054788|D014026|D014027,"

In this study, Y3 was demonstrated to interact with TMV coat protein (TMV-CP) in vitro as well as in tobacco plants by using a yeast two-hybrid system and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). To explore the interaction site between Y3 and TMV-CP, the phenylalanine (Phe) at the 43rd and arginine (Arg) at the 55th amino acid of Y3 were individually converted to cysteine (Cys) and serine (Ser), named Y3T1 and Y3T2, respectively, and were then used in BiFC assays. Based on the information obtained about disulfide bonds in the protein structure, the two mutations were predicted to change the protein's disulfide bonds. The results showed Y3T1 lost the ability to interact with TMV-CP, suggesting that a specific Phe of Y3 is critical for the interaction between Y3 and CP in plants. Furthermore, a prokaryotic expression system was used to test the antiviral activities of protein Y3 (PY3) and two other mutated proteins (P-Y3T1, P-Y3T2). The results showed that recombinant protein P-Y3 had a slightly lower inhibitory effect against TMV than Y3 extracted directly from mushrooms; further, P-Y3T1 decreased antiviral activity in the tobacco plant significantly compared with P-Y3, suggesting that the anti-TMV effect of Y3 was directly related to the Y3-CP interaction. In contrast, P-Y3T2 was able to still interact with TMV-CP in the tobacco plant, and it increased the ability of the plant to resist TMV compared with PY3, indicating that PY3-T2 could be a candidate peptide for plant protection against TMV and that Y3 may have other inhibitory mechanisms against TMV in addition to its interaction with TMV-CP.",eng,2019,10,23,2020,7,28,ppublish,Coprinus|Plant Diseases|Recombinant Proteins|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D003302|D010935|D011994|D014026|D014027,Coprinus comatus|Point mutation|Prokaryotic expression|Tobacco mosaic virus|Y3 protein

In addition to localizing RNA molecules to specific subcellular sites, plants have the ability to exchange RNA molecules between cells through plasmodesmata (PD). Plant RNA viruses hijack the mechanisms of intracellular and intercellular RNA transport to establish localized replication centers within infected cells and then to disseminate their infectious genomes between cells and throughout the plant organism with the help of their movement proteins (MP). In this chapter, we describe the transient expression of the tobacco mosaic virus movement protein (TMV-MP) and the application of the MS2 system for the in vivo labeling of the MP-encoding mRNA. The MS2 method is based on the binding of the bacteriophage coat protein (CP) to its origin of assembly (OAS) in the phage RNA. Thus, to label a specific mRNA in vivo, a tandem repetition of a 19-nucleotide-long stem-loop (SL)Â sequence derived from the MS2Â OAS sequence (MSL) is transcriptionally fused to the RNA under investigation. The RNA is detected by the co-expression of fluorescent protein-tagged MS2 CP (MCP), which binds to each of the MSL elements.

Potyviruses represent the largest group of known plant-infecting RNA viruses, including many agriculturally important viruses. To better understand intercellular movement of potyviruses, we used turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) as a model and constructed a double-fluorescent (green and mCherry) protein-tagged TuMV infectious clone, which allows distinct observation of primary and secondary infected cells. We conducted a series of deletion and mutation analyses to characterize the role of TuMV coat protein (CP) in viral intercellular movement. TuMV CP has 288 amino acids and is composed of three domains: the N-terminus (amino acids 1-97), the core (amino acids 98-245), and the C-terminus (amino acids 246-288). We found that deletion of CP or its segments amino acids 51-199, amino acids 200-283, or amino acids 265-274 abolished the ability of TuMV to spread intercellularly but did not affect virus replication. Interestingly, deletion of amino acids 6-50 in the N-terminus domain resulted in the formation of aberrant virions but did not significantly compromise TuMV cell-to-cell and systemic movement. We identified the charged residues R178 and D222 within the core domain that are essential for virion formation and TuMV local and systemic transport in plants. Moreover, we found that trans-expression of the wild-type CP either by TuMV or through genetic transformation-based stable expression could not rescue the movement defect of CP mutants.

Three fungi, namely Fusarium culmorum MN398395, Rhizoctonia solani MN398397, and Botrytis cinerea MN398399 were used to colonize wood blocks of chinaberry that was previously treated with different concentrations of ECBE at 1%, 2%, and 3%. Antiviral evaluations (protective, curative, and inactivating activities) of the extract at 100Â Î¼g/mL were assayed against Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) MG264131 using the half-leaf method to determine the inhibitory percentage towards the number of local lesions. The protective treatment of Nicotiana glutinosa leaves exhibited excellent activity (72.22%) with a 91.1-fold reduction in TMV-CP accumulation in infected tissues. Furthermore, Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that the expression level of PAL and PR-1 (salicylic acid marker) genes were significantly up regulated at four days-post inoculation (dpi) for all treatments compared to untreated leaves. The insecticidal effect was screened by the contact and fumigant methods against Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and Sitophilus oryzae L. in vitro. In contact assay, all concentrations 1, 5, 10, 20 and 30Â ppm caused 100% toxicity to the two tested pests within 24Â h, whereas the fumigant assay, gave the highest mortality against T. castaneum and S. oryzae by 20Â ppm (61.66%) and 30Â ppm (57.77%), respectively after 24Â h. The HPLC analysis of ECBE revealed that benzoic acid, quinol, salicylic acid, myricetin, and rutin were the most abundant polyphenolic compounds found in the extract. In conclusion, when the extract concentration increases, the growth of fungal mycelia was decreased compared with the control, especially against F. culmorum.

Thus, the interactions involving viral RNA could be excluded. It was found that deletions precluding eVLP assembly did not allow for protein accumulation either, probably indicating that non-assembled CP protein was degraded in the plant leaves. Deletions involving the CP structural core were incompatible with particle assembly. On the N-terminal domain, only the deletion avoiding the subdomain involved in interactions with other CP subunits was incorporated into eVLPs. The C-terminal domain was shown to be more permissive to deletions. Assembled eVLPs were found for mutants, eliminating the whole domain. The C-terminal domain mutants were unusually long, suggesting some role of the domain in the regulation of particle length.

Generic methods for biofunctionalization that enable precise control over biocomponent assembly at the nano and meso scales are necessary to diversify the range and capabilities of these systems. Here, we used tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) derived virus like particles (VLPs) as 3D interfacial scaffolds for the assembly of biosynthetic enzymes onto gold electrodes. The TMV capsids are aligned in a vertical brush configuration by cysteine modifications to the capsid protein and by taking advantage of the well-known gold/cysteine affinity. This alignment enables high surface density and biosynthetic enzyme-enzyme proximity. Enzymes are covalently tethered to the capsid protein of TMV by the N- and C-terminal addition of lysine-rich assembly domains which react with surface exposed glutamine residues on the capsid surfaces; the lysine/glutamine linkages are mediated by a microbial transglutaminase (mTG). We demonstrate flexible mTG-mediated assembly of a three-enzyme biosynthetic pathway that converts S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) to autoinducer-2 (AI-2), a bacterial signal molecule that mediates quorum sensing behavior.

266,32479550,PloS one,WY7 is a newly identified promoter from the rubber powdery mildew pathogen that regulates exogenous gene expression in both monocots and dicots.,10.1371/journal.pone.0233911,"Promoters are very important for transcriptional regulation and gene expression, and have become invaluable tools for genetic engineering. Owing to the characteristics of obligate biotrophs, molecular research into obligate biotrophic fungi is seriously lagging behind, and very few of their endogenous promoters have been developed. In this study, a WY7 fragment was predicted in the genome of Oidium heveae Steinmann using PromoterScan. Its promoter function was verified with transient transformations (Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, ATMT) in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi nc. The analysis of the transcription range showed that WY7 could regulate GUS expression in both monocots (Zea mays Linn and Oryza sativa L. spp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare) and dicots (N. tabacum and Hylocereus undulates Britt). The results of the quantitative detection showed that the GUS transient expression levels when regulated by WY7 was more than 11.7 times that of the CaMV 35S promoter in dicots (N. tabacum) and 5.13 times that of the ACT1 promoter in monocots (O. sativa). GUS staining was not detected in the T1 generation of the WY7-GUS transgenic N. tabacum. This showed that WY7 is an inducible promoter. The cis elements of WY7 were predicted using PlantCARE, and further experiments indicated that WY7 was a low temperature- and salt-inducible promoter. Soluble proteins produced by WY7-hpa1Xoo transgenic tobacco elicited hypersensitive responses (HR) in N. tabacum leaves. N. tabacum transformed with pBI121-WY7-hpa1Xoo exhibited enhanced resistance to the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). The WY7 promoter has a lot of potential as a tool for plant genetic engineering.

However, access to the vascular phloem is highly regulated, representing a significant obstacle to virus loading, movement, and subsequent unloading into distal uninfected tissues. Recent studies indicate that during virus infection, phloem tissues are a source of significant transcriptional and translational alterations, with the number of virus-induced differentially expressed genes being four- to sixfold greater in phloem tissues than in surrounding nonphloem tissues. In addition, viruses target phloem-specific components as a means to promote their own systemic movement and disrupt host defense processes. Combined, these studies provide evidence that the vascular phloem plays a significant role in the mediation and control of host responses during infection and as such is a site of considerable modulation by the infecting virus.

Therefore, it is very important to study the molecular level interaction of HcPro with different cellular components. In this study, we demonstrate that the HcPro interacts with RuBisCo, an enzyme of chloroplast origin which might plays a crucial role in virus infection. A further line of experiments were carried out with factors of nuclear origin. Due to nucleic acid binding activity of HcPro, it showed interaction with dsDNA of nucleosome, as ascertained through electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).

The Rysto gene, conferring a broad spectrum of durable resistance, originated from Solanum stoloniferum and was introgressed into several commercial potato cultivars, including 'White Lady', by classical breeding. Rysto was mapped to chromosome XII in potato, and markers used for marker-assisted selection in breeding programmes were identified. Nevertheless, there was no information on the identity of the Rysto gene. To begin to reveal the identification of Rysto, fine-scale genetic mapping was performed which, in combination with chromosome walking, narrowed down the locus of the gene to approximately 1 Mb. DNA sequence analysis of the locus identified six full-length NBS-LRR-type (short NLR-type) putative resistance genes. Two of them, designated TMV2 and TMV3, were similar to a TMV resistance gene isolated from tobacco and to Y-1, which co-segregates with Ryadg, the extreme virus resistance gene originated from Solanum andigena and localised to chromosome XI. Furthermore, TMV2 of 'White Lady' was found to be 95% identical at the genomic sequence level with the recently isolated Rysto gene of the potato cultivar 'Alicja'.

Compared to other organisms, in-depth profiling of plant phosphoproteome remains challenging due to the harsh extraction environment of plant proteins and low abundance of plant phosphorylation, generally requiring large amount of plant materials. Herein, we developed an integrated strategy for efficient sample preparation of amounts of plant tissues, by integrating ionic liquid (IL)-assisted protein extraction, in-solution digestion, precipitation-assisted IL removal, as well as immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) enrichment of phosphopeptides together. In this strategy, to improve the efficiency of protein extraction and enzymatic digestion, IL of 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (C12Im-Cl) was used as the solubilizer due to its excellent solubilizing ability and enzyme compatibility demonstrated in our previous work. Briefly, the extraction capability of C12Im-Cl for protein amount from tobacco leaves was improved 1.9-fold compared to the commonly used urea-assisted method.

Betasatellites encode one protein, named Î²C1, on the complementary strand; Î²C1 functions as a pathogenicity factor and RNA silencing suppressor. In this report, we describe the identification of another betasatellite-encoded protein, Î²Vl, which also contributes to symptom development. The Î²Vl open reading frame can be found on the viral strand of approximately 40% of reported betasatellite sequences, and is conserved in position and sequence. The presence of the Î²Vl transcript was observed in plants infected with Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYTCCNV) along with its associated betasatellite Tomato yellow leaf curl China betasatellite (TYTCCNB). Mutant viruses unable to produce Î²Vl showed reduced virulence and decreased viral load. Ectopic expression of the TYTCCNB-PV1 gene in Nicotiana benthamiana plants from a PVX-based vector resulted in leaf mosaic and chlorosis. We further demonstrated that the Î²Vl protein could elicit hypersensitive response (HR)-type cell death in N. benthamiana leaves.

Chemical conjugation of TMV-N-lys virions and target influenza antigen M2e expressed in E. coli was performed using 5 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide and 1 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide. The efficiency of chemical conjugation was confirmed by Western blotting. For additional characterization we used conventional electron microscopy. The diameter of the complexes did not differ significantly from the initial TMV-N-lys virions, but complexes formed highly organized and extensive network with dense ""grains"" on the surface. Dynamic light scattering demonstrated that the single peaks, reflecting the complexes TMV-N-lys/DHFR-M2e were significantly shifted relative to the control TMV-N-lys virions.

While these methods have been successful for the analysis of small particles, their impact on fibrillar assemblies has been more limited. The micrometre-range size of these assemblies and the complex interaction of their periodicities in their scattering profiles indicate that the discovery of fibril structures from SAXS measurements requires novel approaches beyond extending existing tools for molecular discovery. In this work, it is proposed to use SAXS measurements, together with diffraction theory, to infer the electron distribution of the average cross-section of a fiber. This cross-section is modeled as a discrete electron density with continuous support, allowing representations beyond binary distributions. Additional constraints, such as non-negativity or smoothness/connectedness, can also be added to the framework. The proposed approach is tested using simulated SAXS data from amyloid Î² fibril models and using measured data of Tobacco mosaic virus from SAXS experiments, recovering the geometry and density of the cross-sections in all cases. The approach is further tested by analyzing SAXS data from different amyloid Î² fibril assemblies, with results that are in agreement with previously proposed models from cryo-EM measurements.

We established a transient expression system using Turnip mosaic virus vector in M. incana. Garden stock (Matthiola incana (L.) R. Br.) is a popular flowering plant observed from winter to spring in Japan. Here we observed that anthocyanin accumulation in 'Vintage Lavender' increased with flower development, whereas flavonol accumulation remained constant throughout flower development. We obtained five transcription factor genes, MiMYB1, MibHLH1, MibHLH2, MiWDR1, and MiWDR2, from M. incana floral cDNA contigs. Yeast two-hybrid analyses revealed that MiMYB1 interacted with MibHLH1, MibHLH2, and MiWDR1, but MiWDR2 did not interact with any transcription factor. Expression levels of MiMYB1 and MibHLH2 increased in petals during floral bud development. Their expression profiles correlated well with the temporal profiles of MiF3'H, MiDFR, MiANS, and Mi3GT transcripts and anthocyanin accumulation profile. On the other hand, MibHLH1 was expressed weakly in all organs of 'Vintage Lavender'. However, high expression levels of MibHLH1 were detected in petals of other cultivars with higher levels of anthocyanin accumulation than 'Vintage Lavender'. MiWDR1 and MiWDR2 maintained constant expression levels in petals during flower development and vegetative organs. Transient MiMYB1 expression in 1-month-old M. incana seedlings using a Turnip mosaic virus vector activated transcription of the endogenous anthocyanin biosynthetic genes MiF3'H, MiDFR, and MiANS and induced ectopic anthocyanin accumulation in leaves. Therefore, MiMYB1 possibly interacts with MibHLH2 and MiWDR1, and this trimeric protein complex activates the transcription of anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in M. incana flowers. Moreover, MibHLH1 acts as an enhancer of anthocyanin biosynthesis with the MiMYB1-MibHLH2-MiWDR1 complex.

Transgenic plants in which these aggregates are developed show resistance toward infection by TMV referred to as CP-MR. This phenomenon has been extensively used to protect transgenic plants against viral diseases. The mutants T42W and E50Q CP confer enhanced CP-MR as compared to the WT CP. The aggregates, when examined, show the presence of helical discs in the case of WT CP; on the other hand, mutants show the presence of highly stable non-helical long rods. These aggregates interfere with the accumulation of MP as well as with the disassembly of TMV in plant cells. Here, we explored an atomic level insight to the process of CP-MR through MD simulations. The subunit-subunit interactions were assessed with the help of MM-PBSA calculations. Moreover, classification of secondary structure elements of the protein also provided unambiguous information about the conformational changes occurring in the two chains, which indicated toward increased flexibility of the mutant protein and seconded the other results of simulations. Our finding indicates the essential structural changes caused by the mutation in CP subunits, which are critically responsible for CP-MR and provides an in silico insight into the effects of these transitions over CP-MR.

However, our understanding of the roles of FD1 in virus infection remains limited. Here, we report that the Potato virus X (PVX) p25 protein interacts with FD1, whose mRNA and protein levels are reduced by PVX infection or by transient expression of p25. Silencing of FD1 by Tobacco rattle virus-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) promoted the local and systemic infection of plants by PVX. Use of a drop-and-see (DANS) assay and callose staining revealed that the permeability of plasmodesmata (PDs) was increased in FD1-silenced plants together with a consistently reduced level of PD callose deposition. After FD1 silencing, quantitative reverse transcription-real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis and LC-MS revealed these plants to have a low accumulation of the phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA), which contributed to the decreased callose deposition at PDs. Overexpression of FD1 in transgenic plants manifested resistance to PVX infection, but the contents of ABA and SA, and the PD callose deposition were not increased in transgenic plants. Overexpression of FD1 interfered with the RNA silencing suppressor function of p25.

E,Bayesian inference for three-dimensional helical reconstruction using a soft-body model.,10.1103/PhysRevE.100.042411,"Estimation of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein using cryo transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) is an inverse problem, which aims to estimate the parameters of a specific physical process from observations. In general, we need to model the observation process to estimate a structure. However, the inconsistency between the model and a real observation process decreases the estimation accuracy. In cryo-TEM, the flexibility of a soft protein, including the bending of a helix, can lead to inconsistencies between the observations because of the assumption that there is a consistent 3D structure behind each observed image. In this paper, we propose a 3D reconstruction algorithm for helical structures using a parametric soft-body model that can represent continuous deformation. We performed an approximate Bayesian inference for unobservable (hidden) variables, such as the deformation parameters, projection angle, and two-dimensional origin offset (shift) of each protein in the 3D structure estimation problem. Our principled approach is not only beneficial to deal with the uncertainties in the estimation, but also beneficial to make the optimization algorithm convergent and efficient. Reconstructions with artificial molecules validated the advantage of the proposed method, particularly, when deformed helices were imaged under a low signal-to-noise ratio condition. Moreover, we confirmed that the proposed method successfully reconstructed a 3D structure from cryo-TEM images of the tobacco mosaic virus.",eng,,,,2019,11,28,ppublish,"Bayes Theorem|Models, Molecular|Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical|Proteins",D001499|D008958|D000072756|D011506,

We first rub-inoculated Rice stripe tenuivirus (RSV), a segmented negative-sense RNA virus that uses cap-snatching to produce capped viral mRNAs, into N. benthamiana. After the inoculation, RSV-infected N. benthamiana were super-infected by CoYVV, CLCuMuV, or RamV, respectively. The capped-RNA leaders snatched by RSV were obtained by determining the 5'-ends of RSV mRNA with high throughput sequencing. Afterwards, snatched capped-RNA leaders of RSV were mapped onto the genome of each begomovirus and those matching the begomoviral genome were considered to come from the 5' ends of assumed begomoviral mRNAs. In this way, TSSs of begomoviruses were obtained.

Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) develops little antibiotic resistance; thus, it becomes a promising strategy in the control of bacterial infection. During a PDI process, light-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage the membrane components, leading to the membrane rupture and bacteria death. Due to the short half-life and reaction radius of ROS, achieving the cell-membrane intercalation of photosensitizers is a key challenge for PDI of bacteria. In this work, a tetraphenylethylene-based discrete organoplatinum(II) metallacycle (1) acts as a photosensitizer with aggregation-induced emission. It self-assembles with a transacting activator of transduction (TAT) peptide-decorated virus coat protein (2) through electrostatic interactions.

The formation and operation of these virus-driven structures require subversion of numerous cellular proteins, membrane deformation, membrane proliferation, changes in lipid composition of the hijacked cellular membranes and intensive viral RNA synthesis. These virus-driven processes require plentiful ATP and molecular building blocks produced at the sites of replication or delivered there. To obtain the necessary resources from the infected cells, tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) rewires cellular metabolic pathways by co-opting aerobic glycolytic enzymes to produce ATP molecules within the replication compartment and enhance virus production. However, aerobic glycolysis requires the replenishing of the NAD+ pool. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficient recruitment of pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1) fermentation enzymes into the viral replication compartment. Depletion of Pdc1 in combination with deletion of the homologous PDC5 in yeast or knockdown of Pdc1 and Adh1 in plants reduced the efficiency of tombusvirus replication. Complementation approach revealed that the enzymatically functional Pdc1 is required to support tombusvirus replication. Measurements with an ATP biosensor revealed that both Pdc1 and Adh1 enzymes are required for efficient generation of ATP within the viral replication compartment. In vitro reconstitution experiments with the viral replicase show the pro-viral function of Pdc1 during the assembly of the viral replicase and the activation of the viral p92 RdRp, both of which require the co-opted ATP-driven Hsp70 protein chaperone. We propose that compartmentalization of the co-opted fermentation pathway in the tombusviral replication compartment benefits the virus by allowing for the rapid production of ATP locally, including replenishing of the regulatory NAD+ pool by the fermentation pathway. The compartmentalized production of NAD+ and ATP facilitates their efficient use by the co-opted ATP-dependent host factors to support robust tombusvirus replication. We propose that compartmentalization of the fermentation pathway gives an evolutionary advantage for tombusviruses to replicate rapidly to speed ahead of antiviral responses of the hosts and to outcompete other pathogenic viruses. We also show the dependence of turnip crinkle virus, bamboo mosaic virus, tobacco mosaic virus and the insect-infecting Flock House virus on the fermentation pathway, suggesting that a broad range of viruses might induce this pathway to support rapid replication.",eng,2019,10,24,2019,10,28,epublish,"Adenosine Triphosphate|Alcohol Dehydrogenase|Fermentation|Glycolysis|HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins|Host-Pathogen Interactions|NAD|Pyruvate Decarboxylase|RNA, Viral|Saccharomyces cerevisiae|Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins|Tobacco|Tombusvirus|Virus Replication",D000255|D000426|D005285|D006019|D018840|D054884|D009243|D011767|D012367|D012441|D029701|D014026|D017864|D014779,

In the present study, we prepared ALSV vectors expressing RNA silencing suppressors (RSSs) from eight plant viruses: P19 of carnation Italian ring spot virus (tombusvirus), 2b of peanut stunt virus (cucumovirus), NSs of tomato spotted wilt virus (tospovirus), HC-Pro of bean yellow mosaic virus (potyvirus), Î³b of barley stripe mosaic virus (hordeivirus), P15 of peanut clump virus (pecluvirus), P1 of rice yellow mottle virus (sobemovirus), or P21 of beet yellows virus (closterovirus). These vectors were inoculated to Nicotiana benthamiana to investigate the effects of RSSs on the virulence and accumulation of ALSV. Among the vectors, ALSV expressing NSs (ALSV-NSs) developed severe mosaic symptoms in newly developed leaves followed by plant death. Infection of ALSV-Î³b induced characteristic concentric ringspot symptoms on leaves, and plants infected with ALSV-HC-Pro showed mosaic and dwarf symptoms. Infection of the other five ALSV vectors did not show symptoms. ELISA and immunoblot assay indicated that virus titer increased in leaves infected with ALSV-NSs, Î³b, HC-Pro, or P19. RT-qPCR indicated that the amount of ALSV in plants infected with ALSV-NSs was increased by approximately 45 times compared with that of wtALSV without expression of any RSS. When ALSV-P19, NSs, or HC-Pro was inoculated to Cucumis sativus plants, none of these ALSV vectors induced symptoms, but accumulation of ALSV in plants infected with ALSV-NSs was increased, suggesting that functions of RSSs on virulence and accumulation of ALSV depend on host species.",eng,2019,10,23,2019,10,28,ppublish,"Gene Expression|Genetic Vectors|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plant Viruses|RNA, Viral|Secoviridae|Tobacco|Viral Proteins",D015870|D005822|D010935|D018515|D010942|D012367|D019180|D014026|D014764,Apple latent spherical virus|RNA silencing suppressor|Viral accumulation|Viral symptoms

These enable a spatially controlled immobilization of functionalities at highest surface densities-an increasing demand worldwide for applications from vaccination to tissue engineering, biocatalysis, and sensing. Certain plant viruses hold particular promise because they are sustainably available, biodegradable, nonpathogenic for mammals, and amenable to in vitro self-organization of virus-like particles. This offers great opportunities for their redesign into novel ""green"" carrier systems by spatial and structural synthetic biology approaches, as worked out here for the robust nanotubular tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as prime example. Natural TMV of 300 x 18ânm is built from more than 2,100 identical coat proteins (CPs) helically arranged around a 6,395 nucleotides ssRNA. In vitro, TMV-like particles (TLPs) may self-assemble also from modified CPs and RNAs if the latter contain an Origin of Assembly structure, which initiates a bidirectional encapsidation. By way of tailored RNA, the process can be reprogrammed to yield uncommon shapes such as branched nanoobjects. The nonsymmetric mechanism also proceeds on 3'-terminally immobilized RNA and can integrate distinct CP types in blends or serially.

Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain GJ-22 is known as a phyllosphere biocontrol agent. In this paper, we described detailed processes of strain GJ-22 colony establishment at various colonization stages. Four different types of bacterial colonies, Type 1, scattered single cells; Type 2, small cell clusters; Type 3, small cell aggregates; and Type 4, large cell aggregates, were observed in the course of bacterial colonization. We categorized bacterial colonization into four phases, which were, Phase I: bacterial colony exists as Type 1 and cell population reduced quickly; Phase II: Type 1 evolved into Type 2 and cell population remained steady; Phase III: Type 3 arose and replaced Type 2, and cell population expanded slowly; and Phase IV: Type 3 matured into Type 4 and cell population increased quickly. We have shown that the preferable location sites of bacterial aggregates on leaf phyllosphere are grooves between plant epidermal cells. Analyses of expressions of plant defence-related genes showed that, starting from Phase III, bacterial cells in the Type 3 and Type 4 colonies produced unidentified signals to induce host defence against Tobacco mosaic virus infection.

It is well established that animal viruses enter host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis for infection. However, the role of endocytosis in plant virus infection still largely remains unknown. Plant dynamin-related proteins 1 (DRP1) and 2 (DRP2) are the large, multidomain GTPases that participate together in endocytosis. Recently, we have discovered that DRP2 is co-opted by Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) for infection in plants. We report here that DRP1 is also required for TuMV infection. We show that overexpression of DRP1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtDRP1A) promotes TuMV infection, and AtDRP1A interacts with several viral proteins including VPg and cylindrical inclusion (CI), which are the essential components of the virus replication complex (VRC). AtDRP1A colocalizes with the VRC in TuMV-infected cells. Transient expression of a dominant negative (DN) mutant of DRP1A disrupts DRP1-dependent endocytosis and supresses TuMV replication. As adaptor protein (AP) complexes mediate cargo selection for endocytosis, we further investigated the requirement of AP in TuMV infection. Our data suggest that the medium unit of the AP2 complex (AP2Î²) is responsible for recognizing the viral proteins as cargoes for endocytosis, and knockout of AP2Î² impairs intracellular endosomal trafficking of VPg and CI and inhibits TuMV replication. Collectively, our results demonstrate that DRP1 and AP2Î² are two proviral host factors of TuMV and shed light into the involvement of endocytosis and endosomal trafficking in plant virus infection.",eng,2019,11,13,2019,9,29,ppublish,"Arabidopsis Proteins|Dynamins|Endocytosis|Endosomes|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Gene Knockout Techniques|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Plant Diseases|Plant Viruses|Plants, Genetically Modified|Potyvirus|Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs|RNA Viruses|Tobacco|Viral Proteins|Virus Replication",D029681|D034281|D004705|D011992|D018506|D055786|D054884|D010935|D010942|D030821|D017800|D054730|D012328|D014026|D014764|D014779,"

It is assumed that the meristem exclusion of the virus is essential to this process. The discovery of RNA silencing provided a possible mechanism to explain meristem exclusion and recovery. Here we show evidence that silencing is not the reason for meristem exclusion in Nicotiana benthamiana plants infected with Cymbidium ringspot virus (CymRSV). Transcriptome analysis followed by in situ hybridization shed light on the changes in gene expression in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) on virus infection. We observed the down-regulation of meristem-specific genes, including WUSCHEL (WUS). However, WUS was not down-regulated in the SAM of plants infected with meristem-invading viruses such as turnip vein-clearing virus (TVCV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Moreover, there is no connection between loss of meristem function and fast shoot necrosis since TVCV necrotized the shoot while CMV did not. Our findings suggest that the observed transcriptional changes on virus infection in the shoot are key factors in tip necrosis and symptom recovery.

A total of 1346 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the leaves of L. regale upon CMV inoculation, which contained 34 up-regulated and 40 down-regulated DEGs that encode putative transcription factors (TFs). One up-regulated TF, LrNAC35, belonging to the NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) superfamily, was selected for further functional characterization. Aside from CMV, lily mottle virus and lily symptomless virus infections provoked a striking increase in LrNAC35 transcripts in both resistant and susceptible Lilium species. The treatments with low temperature and several stress-related hormones activated LrNAC35 expression, contrary to its reduced expression under salt stress. Ectopic overexpression of LrNAC35 in petunia (Petunia hybrida) resulted in reduced susceptibility to CMV and Tobacco mosaic virus infections, and enhanced accumulation of lignin in the cell walls. Four lignin biosynthetic genes, including PhC4H, Ph4CL, PhHCT and PhCCR, were found to be up-regulated in CMV-infected petunia lines overexpressing LrNAC35.

We investigated whether autophagy-related genes (ATGs) are involved in infection with Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. Initially, we observed that BaMV infection in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves upregulated the expression of ATGs but did not trigger cell death. The induction of ATGs, which possibly triggers autophagy, increased rather than diminished BaMV accumulation in the leaves, as revealed by gene knockdown and transient expression experiments. Furthermore, the inhibitor 3-methyladenine blocked autophagosome formation and the autophagy inducer rapamycin, which negatively and positively affected BaMV accumulation, respectively. Pull-down experiments with an antibody against orange fluorescent protein (OFP)-NbATG8f, an autophagosome marker protein, showed that both plus- and minus-sense BaMV RNAs could associate with NbATG8f. Confocal microscopy revealed that ATG8f-enriched vesicles possibly derived from chloroplasts contained both the BaMV viral RNA and its replicase. Thus, BaMV infection may induce the expression of ATGs possibly via autophagy to selectively engulf a portion of viral RNA-containing chloroplast. Virus-induced vesicles enriched with ATG8f could provide an alternative site for viral RNA replication or a shelter from the host silencing mechanism.",eng,,,,2019,9,26,ppublish,Autophagy|Chloroplasts|Plant Diseases|Potexvirus|Tobacco|Virus Replication,D001343|D002736|D010935|D017863|D014026|D014779,3-MA|ATG5|BaMV|autophagy|chlorophagy|chloroplast|rapamycin|viral RNA replication

Recent studies show that ARGOS genes are involved in the regulation of plant growth under the influence of stress factors. However, the role of ARGOS genes in this process is poorly known. Thereby, our goal was to determine the expression profile of these genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum in response to phytohormone treatment and stress factors. We discovered that expression of the AtARGOS and AtARGOS-LIKE genes of A. thaliana is regulated by ethylene and depends on environmental conditions. The highest expression level of the NtARGOS-LIKE1 gene of tobacco (NtARL1) was observed in blooming flowers and young organs. It was induced by auxins, ethylene, ABA, methyl jasmonate as well as hypothermia, drought, salinity and heat stresses. To evaluate the impact of ARGOS genes on plant growth under stress, we created transgenic tobacco plants with constitutive expression of the AtARGOS-LIKE gene of A. thaliana (AtARL), controlled by a strong Dahlia mosaic virus promoter. Overexpression of the AtARL gene contributed to an increase in the volume and quantity of mesophyll cells in the leaves of tobacco under normal conditions, and also to an improvement in root growth under salinity, cold and cadmium treatment. The AtARL transgene produced a positive effect on shoot growth when exposed to drought and high salinity, and a negative effect under cold stress.

382,31436278,Nanoscale,A single-molecule atomic force microscopy study reveals the antiviral mechanism of tannin and its derivatives.,10.1039/c9nr05410c,"Antiviral agents work by stopping or intervening the virus replication. Virus replication is a fast and multi-step process while effective antiviral intervention requires agents to interact with the protein coat, genetic RNA/DNA or both during virus replication. Thus, quantifying these interactions at the molecular level, although it is quite challenging, is very important for an understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism of antiviral intervention. Here, at the single molecule level, we employ single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) in combination with AFM imaging and choose tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)/tannin as a model system of tubular virus to directly study how the inhibitor influences the interactions of RNA and coat protein. We illustrated the antiviral mechanism of tannin during the three main stages of TMV infection, i.e., before the entry of cells, the disassembly of genetic RNA and reassembly of genetic RNA, respectively. Our SMFS results show that tannin and its derivatives can stabilize the TMV complex by enhancing the interactions between RNA and coat protein via weak interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In addition, the stabilization effect showed molecular weight dependence, i.e., for higher molecular weight tannin the stabilization occurs after genetic RNA gets partially disassembled from the protein coat, while the lower molecular weight tannin hydrolyte starts experiencing the stabilization effect before the RNA disassembly. Furthermore, the cycling stretching-relaxation experiments in the presence/absence of tannin proved that tannin can prevent the assembling of RNA and coat protein. In addition, the AFM imaging results demonstrate that tannin can cause the aggregation of TMV particles in a concentration-dependent manner; a higher concentration of tannin will cause more severe aggregations. These results deepen our understanding of the antiviral mechanism of tannin and its derivatives, which facilitate the rational design of efficient agents for antiviral therapy.",eng,2019,08,22,2019,8,23,ppublish,"Antiviral Agents|Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions|Microscopy, Atomic Force|RNA, Viral|Tannins|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Viral Envelope Proteins",D000998|D057927|D018625|D012367|D013634|D014027|D014759,

Fourteen NtabRboh genes were positioned on ten chromosomes (i.e., Ch1, 2, 4, 7-11, 14 and 21), and six scaffolds. Synteny and evolutionary analysis showed that most of the NtabRboh genes have evolved from the genomes of the ancestor species (N.â¯tomentosiformis and N.â¯sylvestris), which afterwards expanded through duplication events.

However, we know very little about NLR-interacting proteins and the mechanisms that regulate NLR levels. Here, we used proximity labeling (PL) to identify the proteome proximal to N, which is an NLR that confers resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Evaluation of different PL methods indicated that TurboID-based PL provides more efficient levels of biotinylation than BioID and BioID2 in plants. TurboID-based PL of N followed by quantitative proteomic analysis and genetic screening revealed multiple regulators of N-mediated immunity. Interestingly, a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBR7, directly interacts with the TIR domain of N. UBR7 downregulation leads to an increased amount of N protein and enhanced TMV resistance. TMV-p50 effector disrupts the N-UBR7 interaction and relieves negative regulation of N.

In the ensuing decades, research focused on discovering and eliminating viral threats to plant and animal health. However, recent conceptual and methodological revolutions have made it clear that viruses are not merely agents of destruction but essential components of global ecosystems. As plants make up over 80% of the biomass on Earth, plant viruses likely have a larger impact on ecosystem stability and function than viruses of other kingdoms. Besides preventing overgrowth of genetically homogeneous plant populations such as crop plants, some plant viruses might also promote the adaptation of their hosts to changing environments. However, estimates of the extent and frequencies of such mutualistic interactions remain controversial. In this Review, we focus on the origins of plant viruses and the evolution of interactions between these viruses and both their hosts and transmission vectors.

Because of the huge economic loss in quality and quantity in the orchid industry with virus-infected orchids, virus-resistant orchids are urgently needed. To date, no transgenic resistant lines against these two viruses have been reported. In this study, we generated transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana expressing various constructs of partial CymMV and ORSV genomes. Several transgenic lines grew normally and remained symptomless after mixed inoculation with CymMV and ORSV. The replication of CymMV and ORSV was approximately 70-90% lower in protoplasts of transgenic lines than wild-type (WT) plants. Of note, we detected extremely low or no viral RNA or capsid protein of CymMV and ORSV in systemic leaves of transgenic lines after co-infection. Grafting experiments further revealed that CymMV and ORSV trafficked extremely inefficiently from co-infected WT stocks to transgenic scions, presumably due to RNA-mediated interference.

The summary statistics PS, AI and MC showed a strong TVBMV-geography association between the isolates from Southwest China (SW) and Mainland China (MC). Further analysis indicated that the spatial genetic structure of TVBMV populations is likely to have been caused by natural selection. Phylogeographic analysis provided strong support for spatial diffusion pathways between the Southwest and Northwest tobacco-producing regions. The TVBMV CP gene was found to be under negative selection, and no significant positive selection of amino acids was detected in the SW group; however, the isolates of the MC group experienced significant positive selection pressure at the first and third amino acid sites of CP.

Argonaute proteins (AGOs) are the key players in RNA silencing. The number of AGO family members involved varies depending on the plant species and they play distinct or sometimes redundant roles in antiviral defense. By using a virus-induced gene silencing technique, it was found that Nicotiana benthamiana AGO1 restricted Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) accumulation, but NbAGO10, the closest paralog of NbAGO1, positively regulated BaMV accumulation. Immunoprecipitation assay revealed BaMV virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) in NbAGO10 complexes. Transient overexpression of NbAGO10 increased BaMV RNA accumulation, but with co-expression of NbAGO1, BaMV RNA accumulation was reduced, which suggests that NbAGO10 may have competed with NbAGO1 for sequestering BaMV vsiRNA and prevented the formation of RNA-induced silencing complexes. In addition, overexpression of NbAGO10 decreased BaMV vsiRNA accumulation. A host enzyme, small RNA degrading nuclease 1 (SDN1), also was found to interact with NbAGO10 on in vivo pull-down assay. Silencing of SDN1 elevated BaMV vsiRNA level and decreased BaMV RNA accumulation in N.Â benthamiana, indicating that NbAGO10 might recruit SDN1 for BaMV vsiRNA degradation.

Here, we report a cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-associated satRNA (sat-T1) that ameliorated CMV-induced symptoms, accompanied with a significant reduction in the accumulation of viral genomic RNAs 1 and 2, which encode components of the viral replicase. Intrans replication assays suggest that the reduced accumulation is the outcome of replication competition. The structural basis of sat-T1 responsible for the inhibition of viral RNA accumulation was determined to be a three-way branched secondary structure that contains two biologically important hairpins. One is indispensable for the helper virus inhibition, and the other engages in formation of a tertiary pseudoknot structure that is essential for sat-T1 survival. The secondary structure containing the pseudoknot is the first RNA element with a biological phenotype experimentally identified in CMV satRNAs, and it is structurally conserved in most CMV satRNAs. Thus, this may be a generic method for CMV satRNAs to inhibit the accumulation of the helper virus via the newly-identified RNA structure.",eng,,,,2019,7,4,ppublish,"Base Sequence|Cucumber Mosaic Virus Satellite|Cucumovirus|Helper Viruses|Mutation|Nucleic Acid Conformation|Plant Diseases|RNA, Viral|Tobacco|Virus Replication",D001483|D019401|D017799|D006378|D009154|D009690|D010935|D012367|D014026|D014779,

It encodes two replicases (126â¯kDa and 183â¯kDa), a movement protein and a coat protein. These proteins interact with host proteins for successful infection. Some host proteins such as eEF1Î±, Tm-1, TOM1, 14-3-3 proteins directly interact with Tobamovirus replication proteins. There are host proteins in the virus replication complex which do not interact with viral replicases directly, such as pyruvate kinase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We have used Proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) technique to screen for transient or weak protein interactions of host proteins and viral replicase in vivo. We transiently expressed BirA* tagged TMV 126â¯kDa replicase in TMV infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Among 18 host proteins, we identified NbSGT1 as a potential target for further characterization. Silencing of NbSGT1 in N. benthamiana plants increased its susceptibility to TMV infection, and overexpression of NbSGT1 increased resistance to TMV infection. There were weak interactions between NbSGT1 and TMV replicases but no interaction between them was found in Y2H assay. It suggests that the interaction might be transient or indirect. Therefore, the BioID technique is a valuable method to identify weak or transient/indirect interaction(s) between pathogen proteins and host proteins in plants. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: TMV is a well characterized positive-strand RNA virus model for study of virus-plant host interactions. It infects >350 plant species and is one of the significant pathogens of crop loss globally. Many host proteins are involved in TMV replication complex formation. To date there are few techniques available for identifying interacting host proteins to viral proteins. There is limited knowledge on transient or non-interacting host proteins during virus infection/replication. In this study, we used agroinfiltration-mediated in planta BioID technique to identify transiently or non-interacting host proteins to viral proteins in TMV-infected N. benthamiana plants. This technique allowed us to identify potential candidate proteins in the vicinity of TMV 126â¯kDa replicase. We have selected NbSGT1 and its overexpression suppresses TMV replication and increase plant resistance. NbSGT1 is believed to interact transiently or indirectly with TMV replicases in the presence of Hsp90/Hsp70.

Recently, the ribotoxin Ageritin has been isolated from the basidiomycetes Agrocybe aegerita (poplar mushroom), suggesting that ribotoxins are widely distributed among fungi. To gain insights into the protective properties of Ageritin against pathogens and its putative biotechnological applications, we have tested several biological activities of Ageritin, comparing them with those of the well-known ribotoxin Î±-sarcin, and we found that Ageritin displayed, in addition to the already reported activities, (i) antibacterial activity against Micrococcus lysodeikticus, (ii) activity against the tobacco mosaic virus RNA, (iii) endonuclease activity against a supercoiled plasmid, (iv) nuclease activity against genomic DNA, (v) cytotoxicity to COLO 320, HeLa, and Raji cells by promoting apoptosis, and (vi) antifungal activity against the green mold Penicillium digitatum. Therefore, Ageritin and Î±-sarcin can induce resistance not only to insects but also to viruses, bacteria, and fungi. The multiple biological activities of Ageritin could be exploited to improve resistance to different pathogens by engineering transgenic plants.

However, the NbHIN1 overexpressing tobacco plant exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to TMV infection. Moreover, RNA-sequencing revealed the transcriptomic profiling of NbHIN1 overexpression and highlighted the primary effects on the genes in the processes related to biosynthesis of amino acids, plant-pathogen interaction and RNA transport. We also found that overexpression of NbHIN1 highly induced the expression of NbRAB11, suggesting that jasmonic acid signaling pathway might be involved in TMV resistance.

We successfully identified natural substrates of two promiscuous Nicotiana benthamiana UGTs (NbUGT73A24 and NbUGT73A25), orthologues of pathogen-induced tobacco UGT (TOGT) from Nicotiana tabacum, which is involved in the hypersensitive reaction.

The emergence of agricultural diseases caused by geminiviruses is attributed in part to their high rates of recombination, leading to complementary function between viral components across species and genera. We have developed a mastreviral reporter system based on bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV) that replicates to high levels in the plant nucleus, expressing very high levels of GFP. To investigate the potential for complementation of movement function by other geminivirus genera, the movement protein (MP) and nuclear shuttle protein (NSP) from the bipartite begomovirus Bean dwarf mosaic virus (BDMV) were produced and characterized in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. While overexpression of MP and NSP strongly inhibited GFP expression from the mastreviral reporter and caused adverse plant symptoms, optimizing the expression levels of MP and NSP allowed functional cell-to-cell movement. Hybrid virus vectors were created that express BDMV MP and NSP from mastreviral replicons, allowing efficient cell-to-cell movement comparable to native BDMV replicons. We find that the expression levels of MP and NSP must be fine-tuned to provide sufficient MP/NSP for movement without eliciting the plant hypersensitive response or adversely impacting gene expression from viral replicons. The ability to confer cell-to-cell movement to mastrevirus replicons depended strongly on replicon size: 2.1-2.7 kb replicons were efficiently moved, while 3 kb replicons were inhibited, and 3.9 kb replicons were very strongly inhibited.

Here, we elaborated an experimental system for analysis of RNA phloem transport based on an engineered RNA of Potato virus X capable of replication, but not encapsidation and movement in plants. The TLSs of Brome mosaic virus, Tobacco mosaic virus and Turnip yellow mosaic virus were demonstrated to enable the phloem transport of foreign RNA. A miRNA precursor, pre-miR390b, was also found to render RNA competent for the phloem transport. In line with this, sequences of miRNA precursors were identified in a Cucurbita maxima phloem transcriptome, supporting the hypothesis that, at least in some cases, miRNA phloem signaling can involve miRNA precursors. Collectively, the data presented here suggest that RNA molecules can be directed into the phloem translocation pathway by structured RNA elements such as those of viral TLSs and miRNA precursors.",eng,2019,04,09,2019,5,16,ppublish,"Bromovirus|Cucurbita|MicroRNAs|Phloem|Potexvirus|RNA, Plant|RNA, Transfer|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Tymovirus",D017795|D028464|D035683|D052585|D017863|D018749|D012343|D014027|D017806,Phloem|Phloem-mobile RNA|Plant virus|RNA phloem transport|miRNA|miRNA precursor|pre-miRNA|pri-miRNA|tRNA-like structure

Such biocompatible nanotheranostic reagents can be used to facilitate PTT, guided by multimodal magnetic resonance/photoacoustic imaging. The r1-relaxivity of the Gd-TMV-PDA particles at 60 MHz was â¼80 mM-1 s-1, compared to 13.63 mM-1 s-1 for the uncoated Gd-TMV particles. The Gd-TMV-PDA particles also promoted strong near-infrared absorption with high photothermal conversion efficiency (28.9%) and demonstrated excellent photoacoustic contrast.

We have evidence that the multifunctional viral translation transactivator/viroplasmin (TAV) protein from Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) can function as a suppressor of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). TAV interacts specifically with a scaffold protein of the decapping complex VARICOSE (VCS) in the yeast two-hybrid system, and co-localizes with components of the decapping complex in planta. Notably, plants transgenic for TAV accumulate endogenous NMD-elicited mRNAs, while decay of AU-rich instability element (ARE)-signal containing mRNAs are not affected. Using an agroinfiltration-based transient assay we confirmed that TAV specifically stabilizes mRNA containing a premature termination codon (PTC) in a VCS-dependent manner. We have identified a TAV motif consisting of 12 of the 520 amino acids in the full-length sequence that is critical for both VCS binding and the NMD suppression effect. Our data suggest that TAV can intercept NMD by targeting the decapping machinery through the scaffold protein VARICOSE, indicating that 5'-3' mRNA decapping is a late step in NMD-related mRNA degradation in plants.",eng,2019,05,07,2019,5,9,epublish,"Arabidopsis|Arabidopsis Proteins|Caulimovirus|Green Fluorescent Proteins|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay|Plant Leaves|Plants, Genetically Modified|Tobacco|Two-Hybrid System Techniques|Viral Proteins",D017360|D029681|D017796|D049452|D054884|D059365|D018515|D030821|D014026|D020798|D014764,

We now show that Nicotiana benthamiana ALD1 is involved in defence against a virus and that the ethylene pathway also participates in ALD1-mediated resistance. NbALD1 was up-regulated in plants infected with turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). Silencing of NbALD1 facilitated TuMV infection, while overexpression of NbALD1 or exogenous application of pipecolic acid (Pip), the downstream product of ALD1, enhanced resistance to TuMV. The SA content was lower in NbALD1-silenced plants and higher where NbALD1 was overexpressed or following Pip treatments. SA mediated resistance to TuMV and was required for NbALD1-mediated resistance. However, on NahG plants (in which SA cannot accumulate), Pip treatment still alleviated susceptibility to TuMV, further demonstrating the presence of an SA-independent resistance pathway. The ethylene precursor, 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC), accumulated in NbALD1-silenced plants but was reduced in plants overexpressing NbALD1 or treated with Pip. Silencing of ACS1, a key gene in the ethylene pathway, alleviated the susceptibility of NbALD1-silenced plants to TuMV, while exogenous application of ACC compromised the resistance of Pip-treated or NbALD1 transgenic plants.

453,30923966,Archives of virology,A single nucleotide change in the overlapping MP and CP reading frames results in differences in symptoms caused by two isolates of Youcai mosaic virus.,10.1007/s00705-019-04222-z,"Two isolates of Youcai mosaic virus (YoMV) were obtained, and their full-length genomic sequences were determined. Full-length infectious cDNA clones of each isolate were generated in which the viral sequence was under the control of dual T7 and 35S promoters for both in vitro transcript production and agro-infiltration. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of the encoded proteins revealed only four differences between the isolates: three in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (V383I and M492I in the 125-kDa protein and T1245M in the 182-kDa protein); and one in the overlapping region of the movement protein (MP) and coat protein (CP) genes, affecting only the N-terminal domain of CP (CP M17T). One of the isolates caused severe symptoms in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, while the other caused only mild symptoms. In order to identify the amino acid residues associated with symptom severity, chimeric constructs were generated by combining parts of the two infectious YoMV clones, and the symptoms in infected plants were compared to those induced by the parental isolates. This allowed us to conclude that the M17T substitution in the N-terminal domain of CP was responsible for the difference in symptom severity. The M17T variation was found to be unique among characterized YoMV isolates. A difference in potential post-translational modification resulting from the presence of a predicted casein kinase II phosphorylation site only in the CP of isolate HK2 may be responsible for the symptom differences.",eng,2019,03,28,2019,3,30,ppublish,"Capsid Proteins|Plant Diseases|Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide|Protein Processing, Post-Translational|Reading Frames|Sequence Analysis, Protein|Tobacco|Tobamovirus|Viral Proteins|Virulence Factors",D036022|D010935|D020641|D011499|D016364|D020539|D014026|D017898|D014764|D037521,

Biokhimiia,Non-structural Functions of Hordeivirus Capsid Protein Identified in Plants Infected by a Chimeric Tobamovirus.,10.1134/S000629791812012X,"Capsid proteins (CPs) of (+)RNA-containing plant viruses are multifunctional proteins involved in many stages of viral infection cycle, in addition to their main function of virus capsid formation. For example, the tobamoviral CP ensures virus systemic transport in plants and defines the virus-host interactions, thereby influencing the virus host range, virus infectivity, pathogenicity, and manifestation of infection symptoms. Hordeiviruses and tobamoviruses belong to the Virgaviridae family and have rod-shaped virions with a helical symmetry; their CPs are similar in structure. However, no non-structural functions of hordeiviral CPs have been described so far. In this study, we assayed possible non-structural functions of CP from the barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) (hordeivirus). To do this, the genome of turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV) (tobamovirus) was modified by substituting the TVCV CP gene with the BSMV CP gene or its mutants. We found that BSMV CP efficiently replaced TVCV CP at all stages of viral infection. In particular, BSMV CP performed the role of tobamoviral CP in the long-distance transport of the chimeric virus, acted as a hypersensitive response elicitor, and served as a pathogenicity determinant that influenced the symptoms of the viral infection. The chimeric tobamovirus coding for the C-terminally truncated BSMV CP displayed an increased infectivity and was transported in plants in a form of atypical virions (ribonucleoprotein complexes).",eng,,,,2019,3,18,ppublish,"Capsid Proteins|Hybridization, Genetic|Tobacco|Tobamovirus",D036022|D006824|D014026|D017898,

The constructs tested were (i) '2a' consisting of the full-length 2a gene (839 amino acids, aa), (ii) 'Motifs' covering the conserved RdRp motifs (IV-VII) (132 aa) and (iii) 'GDD' located within the conserved RdRp motif VI (GDD, 22 aa). In yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) selection assays the '2a' and 'Motifs' constructs interacted with 96 and 25 library constructs, respectively, while the 'GDD' construct caused transactivation. Y2H-interacting scFvs were analyzed in vivo for their interaction with the 2a and Motifs proteins in a mammalian transient expression system. Eighteen tobacco lines stably transformed with four selected scFvs were produced and screened for resistance against two different CMV isolates. Different levels of resistance and rate of recovery were observed with CMV of both groups I and II, particularly in lines expressing intrabodies against the full-length 2a protein.

To counteract host defence, many plant viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing targeting various stages of RNA silencing. There is increasing evidence that the plants also encode endogenous suppressors of RNA silencing (ESR) to regulate this pathway. In this study, using Agrobacterium infiltration assays, we characterized NgRBP, a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein from Nicotiana glutinosa, as an ESR. Our results indicated that NgRBP suppressed both local and systemic RNA silencing induced by sense- or double-stranded RNA. We also demonstrated that NgRBP could promote Potato Virus X (PVX) infection in N. benthamiana. NgRBP knockdown by virus-induced gene silencing enhanced PVX and Cucumber mosaic virus resistance in N. glutinosa. RNA immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that NgRBP bound to GFP mRNA, dsRNA rather than siRNA. These findings provide the evidence that NgRBP acts as an ESR and the RNA affinity of NgRBP plays the key role in its ESR activity. NgRBP responds to multiple signals such as ABA, MeJA, SA, and Tobacco mosaic virus infection. Therefore, it could participate in the regulation of gene expression under specific conditions.",eng,2019,03,06,2019,3,7,ppublish,"Agrobacterium|Amino Acid Sequence|Arginine|Cucumovirus|Genes, Reporter|Phylogeny|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plant Proteins|RNA Interference|RNA, Small Interfering|RNA-Binding Proteins|Sequence Alignment|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D060054|D000595|D001120|D017799|D017930|D010802|D010935|D018515|D010940|D034622|D034741|D016601|D016415|D014026|D014027,Glycine-rich RNA-binding protein|NgRBP|RNA silencing suppressor

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to CMV infection remain poorly understood. In this study, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of tolerant (Taiyan8) and susceptible (NC82) tobacco cultivars on CMV-infected plants, using mock-inoculated plants as a control. The propagation of CMV in inoculated leaves did not show obvious difference between two cultivars, whereas virus accumulation in systemic leaves of Taiyan8 was smaller than those of NC82 at the same time point. We observed 765 and 1,011 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Taiyan8 and NC82, respectively, in CMV-inoculated leaves. DEGs related to reactive oxygen species, salicylic acid signal transduction, and plant-pathogen interaction were upregulated or downregulated in Taiyan8, which indicates that defense response pathways to CMV were activated in the tolerant cultivar. In addition, we identified several DEGs related to disease defense and stress resistance showing opposing expression patterns in the two cultivars.

In this study we provide evidence that replication of TMVcr-Î122 but not of TMVcr was impaired in P. infestans as well as in tobacco plants used as positive control. The interference was associated with induction of high transcription of dicer-like genes Pidcl2 and NtDCL2 and of RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase Pirdr1 and NtRDR1 in P. infestans and tobacco, respectively. These high transcription levels suggest an RNAi-based response that TMVcr-Î122 mutant was not able to suppress.

Here, we describe the production in plants and anti-HIV activity of a novel bispecific fusion protein consisting of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of the CD4 binding site-specific bNAb VRC01 and the antiviral lectin Avaren, which targets the glycan shield of the HIV-1 envelope (VRC01",eng,2019,03,12,2019,2,8,ppublish,"Antibodies, Bispecific|Antibodies, Neutralizing|HIV Antibodies|HIV-1|Lectins|Protein Engineering|Recombinant Fusion Proteins|Tobacco",D018033|D057134|D015483|D015497|D037102|D015202|D011993|D014026,"

This study showed that a mild strain mutant virus, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-43A could cross protect Nicotiana benthamiana plants against wild-type TMV. Furthermore, we investigated the host responses at the proteome level to identify important host proteins involved in cross-protection. We used the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technique to analyze the proteome profiles of TMV, TMV-43A and cross-protected plants at different time-points. Our results showed that TMV-43A can cross-protect N. benthamiana plants from TMV. In cross-protected plants, photosynthetic activities were augmented, as supported by the increased accumulation of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPS) enzymes, which are crucial for chlorophyll biosynthesis. The increased abundance of ROS scavenging enzymes like thioredoxins and L-ascorbate peroxidase would prevent oxidative damage in cross-protected plants. Interestingly, the abundance of defence-related proteins (14-3-3 and NbSGT1) decreased, along with a reduction in virus accumulation during cross-protection. In conclusion, we have identified several important host proteins that are crucial in cross-protection to counter TMV infection in N. benthamiana plants. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: TMV is the most studied model for host-virus interaction in plants. It can infect wide varieties of plant species, causing significant economic losses. Cross protection is one of the methods to combat virus infection. A few cross-protection mechanisms have been proposed, including replicase/coat protein-mediated resistance, RNA silencing, and exclusion/spatial separation between virus strains. However, knowledge on host responses at the proteome level during cross protection is limited. To address this knowledge gap, we have leveraged on a global proteomics analysis approach to study cross protection. We discovered that TMV-43A (protector) protects N. benthamiana plants from TMV (challenger) infection through multiple host pathways: secondary metabolite biosynthesis, photosynthesis, defence, carbon metabolism, protein translation and processing and amino acid biosynthesis. In the secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathway, enzymes 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGPS) play crucial roles in chlorophyll biosynthesis during cross protection. In addition, accumulation of ROS scavenging enzymes was also found in cross-protected plants, providing rescues from excessive oxidative damage. Reduced abundance of plant defence proteins is correlated to reduced virus accumulation in host plants. These findings have increased our knowledge in host responses during cross-protection.",eng,2019,02,03,2019,2,7,ppublish,Disease Resistance|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plant Proteins|Proteome|Proteomics|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D060467|D010935|D018515|D010940|D020543|D040901|D014026|D014027,1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase|Chlorophyll biosynthesis|Cross-protection|ROS scavenging enzymes|TMV|iTRAQ

In this context, the intrinsic behavior of the TMV disk that promotes its assembly into nanotubes is altered by a synergistic effect of dual functional modifications at the 53rd arginine mutation and the introduction of lysine groups in the periphery at 1st and 158th positions of the TMV disk, which results in the formation of 3D gear-like superstructures. Therein, the 53rd arginine moiety significantly strengthens the linkage between TMV disks in the alkaline environment through hydrogen bond interactions. The charge of lysine-modified lateral surfaces is partially neutralized in the alkaline solution, which induces the TMV disk to form a gear-like architecture to maintain its structural stability by exploiting the electrostatic repulsion between neighboring TMV disks.

HpaG-Xcm, a novel harpin protein, was identified from Xanthomonas citri pv. mangiferaeindicae, which causes bacterial black spot of mango. Here, we describe the predicted structure and functions of HpaG-Xcm and investigate the mechanism of heat resistance. The HpaG-Xcm amino acid sequence contains seven motifs and two Î±-helices, in the N- and C-terminals, respectively. The N-terminal Î±-helical region contains two heptads, which form the coiled-coil (CC) structure. The CC region, which is on the surface of HpaG-Xcm, forms oligomeric aggregates by forming hydrophobic interactions between hydrophobic amino acids. Like other harpins, HpaG-Xcm was heat stable, promoted root growth and induced a hypersensitive response (HR) and systemic acquired resistance in non-host plants. Subjecting HpaG-Xcm to high temperatures altered the gene expression induced by HpaG-Xcm in tobacco leaves, probably due to changes in the spatial structure of HpaG-Xcm. Phenotypic tests revealed that the high-temperature treatments reduced the HR and disease resistance induced by HpaG-Xcm but had little effect on growth promotion.

Comparative analyses revealed that BleICV coat protein (CP) gene promoter is highly divergent from the equivalent region of other begomoviruses (BGVs), with the single exception of Tomato chino La Paz virus (ToChLPV) with which it shares a 23-bp phylogenetic footprint exhibiting dyad symmetry. Systematic examination of the homologous CP promoter segment of 132 New World BGVs revealed the existence of a quasi-palindromic DNA segment displaying a strongly conserved ACTT-(N7)-AAGT core. The spacer sequence between the palindromic motifs is constant in length, but its sequence is highly variable among viral species, presenting a relaxed consensus (TT)GGKCCCY, which is similar to the Conserved Late Element or CLE (GTGGTCCC), a putative TrAP-responsive element. The homologous CP promoter region of Old World BGVs exhibited a distinct organization, with the putative TATA-box overlapping the left half of the ACTT-N7 composite element. Similar CP promoter sequences, dubbed ""TATA-associated composite element"" or TACE, were found in viruses belonging to different Geminiviridae genera, hence hinting unsuspected evolutionary relationships among those lineages. To get cues about the TACE function, the regulatory function of the CLE was explored in distinct experimental systems. Transgenic tobacco plants harboring a GUS reporter gene driven by a promoter composed by CLE multimers expressed high beta-glucuronidase activity in absence of viral factors, and that expression was increased by begomovirus infection. On the other hand, the TrAP-responsiveness of a truncated CP promoter of Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) was abolished by site-directed mutation of the only CLE present in it, whereas the artificial addition of one CLE to the -125 truncated promoter strongly enhanced the transactivation level in tobacco protoplasts. These results indicate that the CLE is a TrAP-responsive element, hence providing valuable clues to interpret the recurrent association of the CLE with the TACE. On the basis of the aforesaid direct evidences and the insights afforded by the extensive comparative analysis of BleICV CP promoter, we propose that the TACE might be involved in the TrAP-mediated derepression of CP gene in vascular tissues.",eng,2019,01,23,2019,1,24,epublish,"Base Sequence|Begomovirus|Capsid Proteins|Geminiviridae|Gene Expression Regulation, Viral|Phylogeny|Plant Diseases|Plants, Genetically Modified|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid|TATA Box|Tobacco",D001483|D053839|D036022|D017791|D015967|D010802|D010935|D030821|D011401|D012045|D016385|D014026,

Spherical particles approximately 30 nm in diameter, composed of a single 20-kDa capsid protein, were observed under an electron microscope in infected naranjilla plants. High-throughput sequencing conducted on inoculated Nicotiana benthamiana plants produced a single sequence contig sharing the closest relationship with several tymoviruses. The entire 6,245-nucleotide genome of a new tymovirus was amplified using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and resequenced with the Sanger methodology. The genome had three open reading frames typical of tymoviruses, and displayed a whole-genome nucleotide identity level with the closest tymovirus, Eggplant mosaic virus, at 71% (90% coverage). This tymovirus from naranjilla was able to systemically infect eggplant, tamarillo, N. benthamiana, and naranjilla. In naranjilla, it produced mosaic, chlorotic spots, and stunting, similar to the symptoms observed in the original plant.

Nonetheless, due to lack of multiple insertion sites in these plant viruses, it is still a big challenge to simultaneously express multiple foreign proteins in single cells. The genome of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) offers an attractive system for expression of multiple foreign proteins owning to a multipartite genome composed of five positive-stranded RNAs. Here, we have established a BNYVV full-length infectious cDNA clone under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter.

New delivery routes are being explored, including direct intratumoral injection via convection-enhanced delivery (CED). While promising, convection-enhanced delivery of traditional chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin (DOX) has seen limited success. Several studies have demonstrated that attaching a drug to polymeric nanoscale materials can improve drug delivery efficacy via CED. We therefore set out to evaluate a panel of morphologically distinct protein nanoparticles for their potential as CED drug delivery vehicles for glioblastoma treatment. The panel consisted of three different virus-like particles (VLPs), MS2 spheres, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) disks and nanophage filamentous rods modified with DOX. While all three VLPs displayed adequate drug delivery and cell uptake in vitro, increased survival rates were only observed for glioma-bearing mice that were treated via CED with TMV disks and MS2 spheres conjugated to doxorubicin, with TMV-treated mice showing the best response. Importantly, these improved survival rates were observed after only a single VLPâ»DOX CED injection several orders of magnitude smaller than traditional IV doses. Overall, this study underscores the potential of nanoscale chemotherapeutic CED using virus-like particles and illustrates the need for further studies into how the overall morphology of VLPs influences their drug delivery properties.",eng,2018,12,05,2018,12,20,epublish,,,bioconjugation|convection-enhanced delivery|doxorubicin|drug delivery|glioblastoma|protein-based nanomaterials|tobacco mosaic virus|viral capsid|virus-like particles

Antifungal proteins (AFPs) secreted by filamentous fungi are promising biomolecules that could be used to develop new antifungal therapies in medicine and agriculture. They are small highly stable proteins with specific potent activity against fungal pathogens. However, their exploitation requires efficient, sustainable and safe production systems. Here, we report the development of an easy-to-use, open access viral vector based on Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). This new system allows the fast and efficient assembly of the open reading frames of interest in small intermediate entry plasmids using the Gibson reaction. The manipulated TMV fragments are then transferred to the infectious clone by a second Gibson assembly reaction. Recombinant proteins are produced by agroinoculating plant leaves with the resulting infectious clones. Using this simple viral vector, we have efficiently produced two different AFPs in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, namely the Aspergillus giganteus AFP and the Penicillium digitatum AfpB. We obtained high protein yields by targeting these bioactive small proteins to the apoplastic space of plant cells. However, when AFPs were targeted to intracellular compartments, we observed toxic effects in the host plants and undetectable levels of protein.

Its 5' end ORF codes for the replicase proteins, namely 126â¯kDa and 183â¯kDa, respectively. These proteins interact with many host proteins to form a virus replication complex (VRC). This study aims to dissect the proteome profile of TMV-infected Nicotiana tabacum in host cellular and molecular pathways. We used the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technique to analyse the differential global proteomic profile of TMV infected and mock infected plants. Out of 1897 total proteins, we identified 407 differentially abundant proteins and grouped them into three functional categories, namely metabolism, cellular processes and signalling processing. Our results showed that photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, plant defence, protein synthesis, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum were significantly altered. Carbon metabolism and photosynthesis were present in very low abundance, whereas accumulation of reactive oxygen species and misfolded proteins lead to the accumulation of thioredoxin H-type 1. In conclusion, we identified several key host proteins that are involved in TMV infection/replication in N. tabacum plants. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: TMV is one of the most widely studied plant virus. It is used as a tool to study host-virus interaction. There are several host proteins reported that facilitate VRC formation and replication of TMV. However, there is limited knowledge in the expression regulation of these host proteins upon TMV infection. This study is the first report that investigates the response of host protein expression involved in TMV infection through a quantitative proteomics technique iTRAQ, combined with LC-MS/MS analysis. We used TMV-infected Nicotiana tabacum plants to investigate the effects of TMV infection on host proteins. Our results revealed differential abundance of proteins involving various pathways in protein translation, protein processing, photosynthesis and plant defence. There was a high abundance of thioredoxin H-type 1, a protein that counters oxidative stress and accelerated regulation of fatty acid synthesis to provide additional lipid molecules for VRC formation. There was a significant reduction in abundance of psaA and psbB proteins in the photosynthetic pathways.

Moreover, the number of differentially expressed proteins was greater in HD than in K326, especially during the rosette growth stage and the fast-growing stage. The galactose metabolism and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-globo series pathways appeared only during the rosette growth stage of HD.

The content of NbKPILP mRNA in intact leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana plant is low but increases significantly upon extended dark exposure or when foreign nucleic acid is overexpressed in the cells. The NbKPILP gene promoter along with the expressed nested aORF are likely to play an important role in maintaining the levels of NbKPILP mRNA. To elucidate the role of NbKPILP promoter, we isolated a fragment of N. benthamiana chromosomal DNA upstream of the NbKPILP transcription start, sequenced it, and created constructs in which reporter E. coli uidA gene coding for Î²-D-glucuronidase (GUS) was placed under control of the NbKPILP promoter. By assessing the efficacy of uidA mRNA synthesis directed by the NbKPILP promoter and 35S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus in a transient expression system, we showed that the levels of GUS accumulation were comparable for both promoters. Prolonged incubation of the agroinjected plants in the darkness stimulated accumulation of the uidA mRNA directed by the NbKPILP promoter. Our experiments indicate that along with regulation at the transcriptional level, expression of NbKPILP mRNA can be affected by expression of the nested aORF controlled by the polypurine block (PPB) located upstream of its start codon, since introduction of mutations in the PPB resulted in significant accumulation of the NbKPILP mRNA.

We use the results of the conformational search as geometric parameters together with an improved tight-binding Hamiltonian to simulate the linear absorption spectra and compare with experimental spectral measurements.

508,30452463,PLoS pathogens,RNA virus evasion of nonsense-mediated decay.,10.1371/journal.ppat.1007459,"Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a host RNA control pathway that removes aberrant transcripts with long 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) due to premature termination codons (PTCs) that arise through mutation or defective splicing. To maximize coding potential, RNA viruses often contain internally located stop codons that should also be prime targets for NMD. Using an agroinfiltration-based NMD assay in Nicotiana benthamiana, we identified two segments conferring NMD-resistance in the carmovirus Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) genome. The ribosome readthrough structure just downstream of the TCV p28 termination codon stabilized an NMD-sensitive reporter as did a frameshifting element from umbravirus Pea enation mosaic virus. In addition, a 51-nt unstructured region (USR) at the beginning of the TCV 3' UTR increased NMD-resistance 3-fold when inserted into an unrelated NMD-sensitive 3' UTR. Several additional carmovirus 3' UTRs also conferred varying levels of NMD resistance depending on the construct despite no sequence similarity in the analogous region. Instead, these regions displayed a marked lack of RNA structure immediately following the NMD-targeted stop codon. NMD-resistance was only slightly reduced by conversion of 19 pyrimidines in the USR to purines, but resistance was abolished when a 2-nt mutation was introduced downstream of the USR that substantially increased the secondary structure in the USR through formation of a stable hairpin. The same 2-nt mutation also enhanced the NMD susceptibility of a subgenomic RNA expressed independently of the genomic RNA. The conserved lack of RNA structure among most carmoviruses at the 5' end of their 3' UTR could serve to enhance subgenomic RNA stability, which would increase expression of the encoded capsid protein that also functions as the RNA silencing suppressor. These results demonstrate that the TCV genome has features that are inherently NMD-resistant and these strategies could be widespread among RNA viruses and NMD-resistant host mRNAs with long 3' UTRs.",eng,2018,11,19,2018,11,20,epublish,"3' Untranslated Regions|Carmovirus|Codon, Nonsense|Codon, Terminator|Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay|Protein Biosynthesis|RNA Interference|RNA Stability|RNA Viruses|RNA, Viral|Ribosomes|Tobacco",D020413|D019184|D018389|D018388|D059365|D014176|D034622|D020871|D012328|D012367|D012270|D014026,

In this work, we studied and developed the plant virus tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as a platform nanotechnology for drug delivery and imaging. Specifically, a serum albumin (SA)-coated TMV formulation was produced. The SA coating fulfils two functions: SA provides a stealth coating for enhanced biocompatibility; it also acts as a targeting ligand enabling efficient tumor accumulation of SA-TMV versus TMV in mouse models of breast and prostate cancer. We demonstrate drug delivery of the chemotherapy doxorubicin (DOX); TMV-delivered DOX outperformed free DOX, resulting in significant delayed tumor growth and increased survival. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability of SA-coated TMV loaded with chelated Gd(DOTA) for magnetic resonance imaging detection of tumors.

Both their crystal morphology and the composition of the enveloping membrane can be manipulated by genetic means, allowing the display of functional moieties on the particle surface. In this study, we explore the generation of a new biomaterial assembly by coupling magnetosomes with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) particles, both functionalized with complementary recognition sites. TMV consists of single-stranded RNA encapsidated by more than 2100 coat proteins, which enable chemical modification via functional groups. Incubation of EmGFP- or biotin-decorated TMV particles with magnetosomes genetically functionalized with GFP-binding nanobodies or streptavidin, respectively, results in the formation of magnetic, mesoscopic, strand-like biocomposites. TMV facilitates the agglomeration of magnetosomes by providing a scaffold. The size of the TMV-magnetosome mesostrands can be adjusted by varying the TMV-magnetosome particle ratios. The versatility of this novel material combination is furthermore demonstrated by coupling magnetosomes and terminal, 5'-functionalized TMV particles with high molecular precision, which results in ""drumstick""-like TMV-magnetosome complexes.

To slow clearance, nanoparticles are frequently stealth-coated to prevent opsonization and immune recognition. Serum albumin (SA) has been used as a bio-inspired stealth coating. To develop this shielding strategy for clinical applications, it is critical to understand the interactions between the immune system and SA-camouflaged nanoparticles. This work investigates the in vivo processing of SA-coated nanoparticles using tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as a model system. In comparing four different SA-formulations, the particles with high SA coverage conjugated to TMV via a short linker performed the best at preventing antibody recognition. Irrelevant of the coating chemistry, all formulations led to similar levels of TMV-specific antibodies after repeat administration in mice; importantly though, SA-specific antibodies were not detected and the TMV-specific antibodies were unable to recognize shielded SA-coated TMV. Upon uptake in macrophages, the shielding agent and nanoparticle separate, where TMV trafficked to the lysosome and SA appears to recycle. The distinct intracellular fates of the TMV carrier and SA shielding agent explain why anti-TMV but not SA-specific antibodies are generated.

P. brassicae encodes a protein, predicted to be secreted, with very limited homology to benzoic acid (BA)/SA-methyltransferase, designated PbBSMT. PbBSMT has a SA- and an indole-3-acetic acid-binding domain, which are also present in Arabidopsis thaliana BSMT1 (AtBSMT1) and, like AtBSMT1, has been shown to methylate BA and SA. In support of the hypothesis that P. brassicae uses PbBSMT to overcome SA-mediated defenses by converting SA into inactive methyl salicylate (MeSA), here, we show that PbBSMT suppresses local defense and provide evidence that PbBSMT is much more effective than AtBSMT1 at suppressing the levels of SA and its associated effects. Basal SA levels in Arabidopsis plants that constitutively overexpress PbBSMT compared with those in Arabidopsis wild-type Col-0 (WT) were reduced approximately 80% versus only a 50% reduction in plants overexpressing AtBSMT1. PbBSMT-overexpressing plants were more susceptible to P. brassicae than WT plants; they also were partially compromised in nonhost resistance to Albugo candida. In contrast, AtBSMT1-overexpressing plants were not more susceptible than WT to either P. brassicae or A. candida. Furthermore, transgenic Arabidopsis and tobacco plants overexpressing PbBSMT exhibited increased susceptibility to virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (DC3000) and virulent Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, respectively. Gene-mediated resistance to DC3000/AvrRpt2 and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was also compromised in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana tabacum 'Xanthi-nc' plants overexpressing PbBSMT, respectively. Transient expression of PbBSMT or AtBSMT1 in lower leaves of N. tabacum Xanthi-nc resulted in systemic acquired resistance (SAR)-like enhanced resistance to TMV in the distal systemic leaves. Chimeric grafting experiments revealed that, similar to SAR, the development of a PbBSMT-mediated SAR-like phenotype was also dependent on the MeSA esterase activity of NtSABP2 in the systemic leaves. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that PbBSMT is a novel effector, which is secreted by P. brassicae into its host plant to deplete pathogen-induced SA accumulation.",eng,2019,02,04,2018,9,11,ppublish,Arabidopsis|Arabidopsis Proteins|Plant Diseases|Plasmodiophorida|Pseudomonas syringae|Salicylic Acid|Virulence,D017360|D029681|D010935|D056909|D044224|D020156|D014774,

NbRACK1 was shown to be recruited by the p27 viral replication protein into endoplasmic reticulum-derived aggregated structures (possible replication sites). Downregulation of NbRACK1 by virus-induced gene silencing inhibited viral cap-independent translation and p27-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, which are prerequisite for RCNMV replication. We also found that NbRACK1 interacted with a host calcium-dependent protein kinase (NbCDPKiso2) that activated a ROS-generating enzyme. Interestingly, NbRACK1 was required for the interaction of p27 with NbCDPKiso2, suggesting that NbRACK1 acts as a bridge between the p27 viral replication protein and NbCDPKiso2.

The HAS strategy has been used as a versatile method for the preparation of soft-matter nanoarchitectures of defined size and morphologies, tunable luminescence, and biological importance. However, such preparation can be greatly simplified if well-defined dynamic structures are employed as the cores that upon linking form the desired nanoarchitectures. Discrete supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) with well-defined shapes, sizes, and internal cavities have been widely employed to construct hierarchical systems with functional diversity. This Account summarizes the prevailing strategies used in recent years in the preparation of SCC-based HASs and illustrates how the combination of dynamic metal-ligand coordination with other interactions was used to obtain hierarchical systems with interesting properties. HASs with dual orthogonal interactions involving coordination-driven self-assembly and hydrogen bonding/host-guest interaction generally result in robust and flexible supramolecular gels. Likewise, hybridization of SCCs with a suitable dynamic covalent network via a hierarchical strategy is useful to prepare materials with self-healing properties. The intrinsic positive charges of the SCCs also make them suitable precursors for the construction of HASs via electrostatic interactions with negatively charged biological/abiological molecules. Furthermore, the interplay between the hydrophilic and lipophilic characters of HASs by varying the number and spacial orientation of alkyl/oxyethylene chains of the SCC is a simple yet controllable approach to prepare ordered and tunable nanostructures. Certain SCC-cored hierarchical systems exhibit reversible polymorphism, typically between micellar, nanofiber, and vesicular phases, in response to various external perturbations: heat, photoirradiation, pH-variance, redox-active agents, etc. At the same time, multiple noncovalent interaction mediated HASs are growing in numbers and are promising candidates for obtaining functionally diverse materials. The photophysical properties of SCC-based HASs have been used in many analytical applications. For example, embedding tetraphenylethene (TPE)-based pyridyl ligands within metallo-supramolecular structures partially restricts the molecular rotations of its phenyl rings, endowing the resultant SCCs with weak emissions. Further aggregation of such HASs in suitable solvents results in a marked enhancement in emission intensity along with quantum yields. They act as sensitive sensors for different analytes, including pathogens, drugs, etc. HASs are also useful to develop multidrug systems with cooperative chemotherapeutic effects. Hence, the use of HASs with theranostic SCCs combining cell-imaging agents and chemotherapeutic scaffolds is a promising drug delivery strategy for cancer theranostics. At the same time, their responsiveness to stimuli, oftentimes due to the dynamic nature of the metal-ligand interactions, play an important role in drug release via a disassembly mechanism.",eng,2018,08,22,2018,8,23,ppublish,"Boron Compounds|Coordination Complexes|Doxorubicin|Drug Carriers|Drug Liberation|Heparin|Hydrogen Bonding|Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions|Ligands|Metals, Heavy|Molecular Structure|Polymers|Rhodamines|Static Electricity|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D001896|D056831|D004317|D004337|D065546|D006493|D006860|D057927|D008024|D019216|D015394|D011108|D012235|D055672|D014027,

These strategies include the development of effective vaccines, such as malaria transmission blocking vaccines (TBV) directed against proteins found on the sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum parasites present in the mosquito midgut. The Pfs25 protein, which is expressed on the surface of gametes, zygotes and ookinetes, has been a primary target for TBV development. One such vaccine strategy based on Pfs25 is a plant-produced malaria vaccine candidate engineered as a chimeric non-enveloped virus-like particle (VLP) comprising Pfs25 fused to the Alfalfa mosaic virus coat protein.

Our previous study demonstrated that changes in Nicotiana tabacum Î±-expansin 4 (EXPA4) expression affect the sensitivity of tobacco to Tobacco mosaic virus [recombinant TMV encoding green fluorescent protein (TMV-GFP)] infection by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression. In this study, to characterize the function of tobacco EXPA4 further, EXPA4 RNA interfernce (RNAi) mutants and overexpression lines were generated and assayed for their tolerance to abiotic stress and resistance to pathogens. First, the differential phenotypes and histomorphology of transgenic plants with altered EXPA4 expression indicated that EXPA4 is essential for normal tobacco growth and development. By utilizing tobacco EXPA4 mutants with abiotic stress, it was demonstrated that RNAi mutants have increased hypersensitivity to salt and drought stress. In contrast, the overexpression of EXPA4 in tobacco conferred greater tolerance to salt and drought stress, as indicated by less cell damage, higher fresh weight, higher soluble sugar and proline accumulation, and higher expression levels of several stress-responsive genes. In addition, the overexpression lines were more susceptible to the viral pathogen TMV-GFP when compared with the wild type or RNAi mutants. The induction of the antioxidant system, several defense-associated phytohormones and gene expression was down-regulated in overexpression lines but up-regulated in RNAi mutants when compared with the wild type following TMV-GFP infection.

The marine environment has been a prolific contributor towards the identification of novel therapeutic agents in the recent few decades. Added to this, glycans (or carbohydrate- or sugar-based compounds) have in very recent decades made outstanding contributions to the development of novel therapeutics. This review brings together these significant facets of modern drug discovery by presenting the reported literature on glycans derived from marine organisms that possess antiviral activity.The glycans have been grouped together based on the marine organism they were isolated from, namely, (1) bacteria, (2) chromists, (3) plants and (4) animals. For chromists, glycans are further subsectioned into Ochrophyta (brown algae), Miozoa (according to www.algaebase.org ; also called Myzozoa according to WoRMS, www.marinespecies.org ) (dinoflagellates) and Bacillariophyta (diatoms). For plants, glycans are further subsectioned into Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta and Tracheophyta.

548,30075014,PLoS pathogens,RNA decay is an antiviral defense in plants that is counteracted by viral RNA silencing suppressors.,10.1371/journal.ppat.1007228,"Exonuclease-mediated RNA decay in plants is known to be involved primarily in endogenous RNA degradation, and several RNA decay components have been suggested to attenuate RNA silencing possibly through competing for RNA substrates. In this paper, we report that overexpression of key cytoplasmic 5'-3' RNA decay pathway gene-encoded proteins (5'RDGs) such as decapping protein 2 (DCP2) and exoribonuclease 4 (XRN4) in Nicotiana benthamiana fails to suppress sense transgene-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (S-PTGS). On the contrary, knock-down of these 5'RDGs attenuates S-PTGS and supresses the generation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). We show that 5'RDGs degrade transgene transcripts via the RNA decay pathway when the S-PTGS pathway is disabled. Thus, RNA silencing and RNA decay degrade exogenous gene transcripts in a hierarchical and coordinated manner. Moreover, we present evidence that infection by turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) activates RNA decay and 5'RDGs also negatively regulate TuMV RNA accumulation. We reveal that RNA silencing and RNA decay can mediate degradation of TuMV RNA in the same way that they target transgene transcripts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VPg and HC-Pro, the two known viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) of potyviruses, bind to DCP2 and XRN4, respectively, and the interactions compromise their antiviral function. Taken together, our data highlight the overlapping function of the RNA silencing and RNA decay pathways in plants, as evidenced by their hierarchical and concerted actions against exogenous and viral RNA, and VSRs not only counteract RNA silencing but also subvert RNA decay to promote viral infection.",eng,2018,08,03,2018,8,4,epublish,"Antiviral Agents|Arabidopsis|Disease Resistance|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Plant Diseases|Plants, Genetically Modified|Potyvirus|RNA Interference|RNA Stability|RNA, Small Interfering|RNA, Viral|Tobacco",D000998|D017360|D060467|D018506|D010935|D030821|D017800|D034622|D020871|D034741|D012367|D014026,

Fluorescent labelling was achieved by replacing a part of the RNA2 encoded coat protein read-through domain with either GFP or mRFP fluorescent marker proteins. This resulted in a translational fusion comprising the coat and the fluorescent protein. The labelled viruses were infectious and moved systemically in Nicotiana benthamiana, producing wild-type-like symptoms. Virus particles could be observed by electron microscopy, demonstrating that the viral read-through domain is dispensable for particle formation. Coinfection experiments revealed a spatial separation of differentially labelled populations of both identical and different Benyvirus species after N. benthamiana agro-inoculation. Identical observations were obtained when Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) was differentially labelled and used for coinfection. In contrast, coinfections of BSBMV with Potato virus X (PVX) or TRV resulted in many co-infected cells lacking spatial separation. Micro-projectile co-bombardment of N. benthamiana leaves revealed that two differently labelled populations of the same virus co-infected only a few cells before starting to separate. In superinfection experiments with N. benthamiana, BSBMV and BNYVV were unable to establish a secondary infection in plants that were previously infected with BNYVV or BSBMV.

Specifically, NDI-L-Glu shows a mixture of left- and right-handed helices under physiological conditions, and any deviation from the ambient biochemical environment has a remarkable influence on the chirality of these structures. For instance, acidic environments shift the helicity to left-handedness while the alkaline conditions reversed the helical structures to right-handedness, thereby mimicking the molecular virulence mechanism of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).

For rapidly producing high levels of a desirable protein, many plant virus vectors have been developed. However, there is always a concern that such recombinant viruses may escape into the environment. Especially for insect-transmissible viruses, certain measures must be taken. We here developed a new cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) RNA 3-based vector that is not transmitted by aphids because we deleted the coat protein (CP) gene responsible for aphid transmission and replaced it with a foreign gene. Transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants expressing CMV RNA 1 (CR1Tg) were found to be the most suitable platform for producing a recombinant protein using the CMV vector. By agroinfiltrating CR1Tg plants with the RNA 2 construct and the CMV vector harboring the green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene instead of the CP gene, we achieved a high yield of GFP (e.g., ~â750Â mg/kg FW) throughout the bacteria-infiltrated tissues at 2-3 days after infiltration.

In this study, we report that a malectin-like/leucine-rich repeat receptor protein kinase gene, RLK-V, from Haynaldia villosa putatively acts as a PRR to positively regulate powdery mildew resistance caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) in wheat. RLK-V has two alternatively spliced transcripts corresponding to an intact RLK-V1.1 and a truncated RLK-V1.2 caused by intron retention. Expression analysis showed that both transcripts could be up-regulated by Bgt in resistant materials, whereas the functional RLK-V1.1 was expressed only after Bgt inoculation. Promoter activity assays indicated that RLK-V could respond to Bgt even in susceptible wheat. Silencing of RLK-V in Pm21-carrying resistant materials resulted in compromised resistance to Bgt. In addition, over-expression of RLK-V1.1 in Pm21-lacking susceptible Yangmai158 and SM-1 by single-cell transient expression and stable transformation in Yangmai158 could improve powdery mildew resistance. We propose that RLK-V regulates basal resistance to powdery mildew, which is also required for broad-spectrum resistance mediated by the Pm21 gene. Over-expression of RLK-V1.1 could trigger cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana, and RLK-V1.1 transgenic wheat accumulated more reactive oxygen species and displayed a stronger hypersensitive response than did the recipient, which led to enhanced Bgt resistance.

He offered a completely new explanation, proposing that the agent was a ""living infectious fluid"" whose reproduction was intimately linked to that of its host cell. Difficult to test at the time, the contagium vivum fluidum languished in obscurity for more than three decades. Subsequent advances in technologies prompted virus researchers of the 1930s and 1940s-the first to separate themselves from bacteriologists-to revive the idea.

These assays are based on ELISA or variations of PCR, which were employed here to determine the presence of blueberry viruses in major blueberry production and nursery areas of the U.S. The viruses included in this study were: blueberry fruit drop (BFDaV), blueberry latent (BlLV), blueberry leaf mottle (BLMoV), blueberry mosaic (BlMaV), blueberry red ringspot (BRRV), blueberry scorch (BlScV), blueberry shock (BlShV), blueberry shoestring (BlSSV), blueberry virus A (BVA), peach rosette mosaic (PRMV), tobacco ringspot (TRSV), and tomato ringspot (ToRSV). In the Pacific Northwest BlShV was the most widespread virus, with BlScV and ToRSV detected in a limited number of fields in Oregon and Washington, but BlScV was widespread in British Columbia. In the upper midwest, the nematode-borne (ToRSV, TRSV), aphid-transmitted (BlSSV and BVA) and pollen-borne (BLMoV) viruses were most widespread. In the northeast, TRSV, ToRSV, and BlScV, were detected most frequently. In the southeast, BRRV and BNRBV were the most widespread viruses. BlLV, a cryptic virus with no known symptoms or effect on plant growth or yield was present in all regions. There are other viruses present at low levels in each of the areas, but with the lower incidence they pose minimal threat to nursery systems or fruit production.

To overcome host defense responses, plant viruses encode silencing-suppressor proteins to target one or several key steps in the silencing machinery.

SVBV P6 protein can suppress green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene silencing induced by single-stranded RNA but not by double-stranded RNA. The P6 protein can also inhibit systemic silencing of GFP through interfering the systemic spread of GFP silencing signal. Subcellular localization study indicated that P6 protein formed irregular bodies and distributed in both cytoplasm and nucleus of Nicotiana benthamiana cells. Furthermore, deletion analysis indicated that a nuclear localization signal (NLS, aa 402-426) in the P6 protein is responsible for the silencing suppression efficiency. In addition, expression of the P6 protein via a Potato virus X (PVX)-based vectors induced more severe mosaic symptoms in N. benthamiana leaves, and transgenic N. benthamiana plants expressing P6 showed obvious vein yellowing as well as severe mosaic symptoms in leaves.

Recently, the AtMKP1 homolog of Nicotiana benthamiana (NbMKP1) was found in association with the Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) replication complex. This study aimed to investigate the role of NbMKP1 in BaMV multiplication in N. benthamiana. Silencing of NbMKP1 increased accumulations of the BaMV-encoded proteins and the viral genomic RNA, although the same condition reduced the infectivity of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 in N. benthamiana. On the other hand, overexpression of NbMKP1 decreased the BaMV coat protein accumulation in a phosphatase activity-dependent manner in protoplasts. NbMKP1 also negatively affected the in vitro RNA polymerase activity of the BaMV replication complex. Collectively, the activity of NbMKP1 seems to reduce BaMV multiplication, inconsistent with the negatively regulatory role of MKP1 in MAPK cascades in terms of warding off fungal and bacterial invasion. In addition, silencing of NbMKP1 increased the accumulation of Foxtail mosaic virus but decreased Potato virus X.

A particularly interesting avenue is the concept of in situ vaccination, where immunostimulatory agents are introduced into an identified tumor to overcome local immunosuppression and, if successful, mount systemic antitumor immunity. We had previously shown that nanoparticles from cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) are highly potent in inducing long-lasting antitumor immunity when used as an in situ vaccine in various tumor mouse models. Here we asked whether the nanoparticles from tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) could also be applied as an in situ vaccine and, if so, whether efficacy or mechanism of immune-activation would be affected by the nanoparticle size (300 Ã 18 nm native TMV vs 50 Ã 18 nm short TMV nanorods), shape (nanorods vs spherical TMV, termed SNP), or state of assembly (assembled TMV rod vs free coat protein, CP). Our studies indicate that CPMV, but less so TMV, elicits potent antitumor immunity after intratumoral treatment of dermal melanoma (B16F10 using C57BL/6 mice). TMV and TMVshort slowed tumor growth and increased survival time, however, at significantly lower potency compared to that of CPMV. There were no apparent differences between TMV, TMVshort, or the SNP indicating that the aspect ratio does not necessarily play a role in plant viral in situ vaccines. The free CPs did not elicit an antitumor response or immunostimulation, which may indicate that a multivalent assembly is required to trigger an innate immune recognition and activation. Differential potency of CPMV vs TMV can be explained with differences in immune-activation: data indicate that CPMV stimulates an antitumor response through recruitment of monocytes into the tumor microenvironment (TME), establishing signaling through the IFN-Î³ pathway, which also leads to recruitment of tumor-infiltrated neutrophils (TINs) and natural killer (NK) cells.

They can also be targeted by antiviral agents. Cytosinpeptidemycin has a good control effect against TMV. However, the mechanism of action is unclear. In this study, we expressed and purified TMV superfamily 1 helicase (TMV-Hel) and analyzed its three-dimensional structure. Furthermore, the binding interactions of TMV-Hel and cytosinpeptidemycin were studied. Microscale thermophoresis and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments showed that cytosinpeptidemycin bound to TMV-Hel with a dissociation constant of 0.24-0.44 Î¼M. Docking studies provided further insights into the interaction of cytosinpeptidemycin with the His375 of TMV-Hel. Mutational and Microscale thermophoresis analyses showed that cytosinpeptidemycin bound to a TMV-Hel mutant (H375A) with a dissociation constant of 14.5 Î¼M. Thus, His375 may be the important binding site for cytosinpeptidemycin.

In the context of photosynthetic light harvesting, the difficulty lies in attaining utmost control over the energetics, positions and relative orientations of chromophores in densely packed arrays to transfer electronic excitation energy to desired locations with high efficiency. Toward achieving this goal, we use a highly versatile biomimetic protein scaffold from the tobacco mosaic virus coat protein on which chromophores can be attached at precise locations via linkers of differing lengths and rigidities. We show that minor linker modifications, including switching chiral configurations and alkyl chain shortening, lead to significant lengthening of the ultrafast excited state dynamics of the system as the linkers are shortened and rigidified. Molecular dynamics simulations provide molecular-level detail over how the chromophore attachment orientations, positions, and distances from the protein surface lead to the observed trends in system dynamics. In particular, we find that short and rigid linkers are able to sandwich water molecules between chromophore and protein, leading to chromophore-water-protein supracomplexes with intricately coupled dynamics that are highly dependent on their local protein environment. In addition, cyclohexyl-based linkers are identified as ideal candidates to retain rotational correlations over several nanoseconds and thus lock relative chromophore orientations throughout the lifetime of an exciton. Combining linker engineering with judicious placement of chromophores on the hydrated protein scaffold to exploit different chromophore-bath couplings provides a clear and effective path to producing highly controllable artificial light-harvesting systems that can increasingly mimic their natural counterparts, thus aiding to elucidate natural photosynthetic mechanisms.",eng,2018,05,09,2018,5,10,ppublish,"Biomimetic Materials|Biomimetics|Capsid Proteins|Coloring Agents|Cross-Linking Reagents|Cyclohexanes|Energy Transfer|Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes|Molecular Dynamics Simulation|Pigments, Biological|Quantum Theory|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Water",D040761|D032701|D036022|D004396|D003432|D003510|D004735|D045342|D056004|D010860|D011789|D014027|D014867,

To meet high-quality standards, e.g., in molecular separation processes, membranes with well-defined pores in terms of pore diameter and chemical properties are required. However, the preparation of membranes with narrow pore diameter distributions is still challenging. In the work presented here, we demonstrate a strategy, a ""pore-in-pore"" approach, where the conical pores of a solid state membrane produced by a multi-step top-down lithography procedure are used as a template to insert precisely-formed biomolecular nanodiscs with exactly defined inner and outer diameters. These nanodiscs, which are the building blocks of tobacco mosaic virus-deduced particles, consist of coat proteins, which self-assemble under defined experimental conditions with a stabilizing short RNA. We demonstrate that the insertion of the nanodiscs can be driven either by diffusion due to a concentration gradient or by applying an electric field along the cross-section of the solid state membrane.

Formation of VRCs requires virus-mediated manipulation of cellular lipid synthesis. Here, we report significantly enhanced brome mosaic virus (BMV) replication and much improved cell growth in yeast cells lacking PAH1 (pah1Î), the sole yeast ortholog of human LIPIN genes. PAH1 encodes Pah1p (phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase), which converts phosphatidate (PA) to diacylglycerol that is subsequently used for the synthesis of the storage lipid triacylglycerol. Inactivation of Pah1p leads to altered lipid composition, including high levels of PA, total phospholipids, ergosterol ester, and free fatty acids, as well as expansion of the nuclear membrane. In pah1Î cells, BMV replication protein 1a and double-stranded RNA localized to the extended nuclear membrane, there was a significant increase in the number of VRCs formed, and BMV genomic replication increased by 2-fold compared to wild-type cells. In another yeast mutant that lacks both PAH1 and DGK1 (encodes diacylglycerol kinase converting diacylglycerol to PA), which has a normal nuclear membrane but maintains similar lipid compositional changes as in pah1Î cells, BMV replicated as efficiently as in pah1Î cells, suggesting that the altered lipid composition was responsible for the enhanced BMV replication. We further showed that increased levels of total phospholipids play an important role because the enhanced BMV replication required active synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, the major membrane phospholipid. Moreover, overexpression of a phosphatidylcholine synthesis gene (CHO2) promoted BMV replication. Conversely, overexpression of PAH1 or plant PAH1 orthologs inhibited BMV replication in yeast or Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Competing with its host for limited resources, BMV inhibited host growth, which was markedly alleviated in pah1Î cells. Our work suggests that Pah1p promotes storage lipid synthesis and thus represses phospholipid synthesis, which in turn restricts both viral replication and cell growth during viral infection.",eng,2018,04,12,2018,4,13,epublish,"Bromovirus|Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Genome, Viral|Nuclear Envelope|Phosphatidate Phosphatase|Phospholipids|Saccharomyces cerevisiae|Tobacco|Virus Replication",D017795|D015966|D018506|D016679|D009685|D010711|D010743|D012441|D014026|D014779,

In previous studies, we found that TMV local-infection on tomato leaves not only caused the PCD process in the distal root tissues, but also induced autophagy in root-tip cells. However, the reasons for these biological phenomena are unclear. In order to get deeper insight, the role of a putative inducible factor reactive oxidative species (ROS) was investigated. The situ staining and subcellular localization analysis showed that the ROS level in the root tissue of TMV infected plants was significantly promoted. TEM observation showed that the intracellular ROS was excreted into the cell wall and intercellular layer. At the same time, the results of western blot and qRT-PCR showed that the expression of autophagy related protein Atg8 and genes (Atg5, Atg7 and Atg10) were increased. However, in the subsequent DPI inhibition experiments we found that the accumulation of ROS in infected plant root-tip tissues was inhibited and the autophagy in the root-tip cells also decreased. When 3-methyladenine (3-MA) was used to inhibit autophagy, there was no significant change in the ROS level in the apical tissue, while the systemic PCD process of the root-tip cells was elevated. Taken together, these results indicate that local TMV inoculation on the leaves induced the root-tip cells producing and releasing a lot of ROS into the extracellular matrix for defense against pathogen invasion.

Beclin1 interacts with NIb, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of TuMV, via the highly conserved GDD motif and the interaction complex is targeted for autophagic degradation likely through the adaptor protein ATG8a. Beclin1-mediated NIb degradation is inhibited by autophagy inhibitors. Deficiency of Beclin1 or ATG8a enhances NIb accumulation and promotes viral infection and vice versa. These data suggest that Beclin1 may be a selective autophagy receptor. Overexpression of a Beclin1 truncation mutant that binds to NIb but lacks the ability to mediate NIb degradation also inhibits virus replication.

Thus, architectures with interconnected nanotube domains in two different length classes were generated, each containing 70 CP subunits per 10 nm length. Short TMV origin-of-assembly-containing RNA scaffolds ligated to the DNA allowed the growth of protein-coated 34 nm tubes on the terminal RNA strands in situ. Alternatively, 290 nm pre-fabricated tubes with accessible RNA 3' termini, attained by DNA blocking elements hybridized to the RNAs, were ligated with the branched cores.

This was, in large part, due to the relative ease with which sufficient quantities of material could be produced for such analyses. As analytical techniques became increasingly sensitive, similar studies could be performed on the viruses from other organisms. However, plant viruses continued to play an important role in the development of molecular biology, including the demonstration that RNA can be infectious, the determination of the genetic code, the mechanism by which viral RNAs are translated, and some of the early studies on gene silencing.

Emerging strategies for crop protection involve the external treatment of plants with double-stranded (ds)RNA to trigger RNA interference. However, applying this technology in greenhouses and fields depends on dsRNA quality, stability and efficient large-scale production. Using components of the bacteriophage phi6, we engineered a stable and accurate inÂ vivo dsRNA production system in Pseudomonas syringae bacteria. Unlike other inÂ vitro or inÂ vivo dsRNA production systems that rely on DNA transcription and postsynthetic alignment of single-stranded RNA molecules, the phi6 system is based on the replication of dsRNA by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thus allowing production of high-quality, long dsRNA molecules. The phi6 replication complex was reprogrammed to multiply dsRNA sequences homologous to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) by replacing the coding regions within two of the three phi6 genome segments with TMV sequences and introduction of these constructs into P.Â syringae together with the third phi6 segment, which encodes the components of the phi6 replication complex. The stable production of TMV dsRNA was achieved by combining all the three phi6 genome segments and by maintaining the natural dsRNA sizes and sequence elements required for efficient replication and packaging of the segments. The produced TMV-derived dsRNAs inhibited TMV propagation when applied to infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The established dsRNA production system enables the broad application of dsRNA molecules as an efficient, highly flexible, nontransgenic and environmentally friendly approach for protecting crops against viruses and other pathogens.",eng,2018,02,26,2018,2,27,aheadofprint,,,RNAi|dsRNA production technology|sustainable crop protection

We found that the AtMP gene is expressed at different stages of the plant development, with accumulation being highest in flowers but lowest in mature siliques. We also found down-regulation of the gene may result in a small delay in plant development and in an exacerbation of the negative effect of salinity in germination efficiency. We have also explored whether changes in expression of the endogenous AtMP have any effect on susceptibility to infection with several viruses, and found that the infectivity of tobacco rattle tobravirus was strongly dependent on the expression of the endogenous AtMP. Finally, we have cloned the endogenous MP from four different plant species into an expression vector that allows for specifically assessing their activity as cell-to-cell movement proteins and have shown that though some may still retain the ancestral activity, they do so in a quite inefficient manner, thus suggesting they have acquired a novel function during adaptation to the host genome.",eng,2018,02,21,2018,2,24,ppublish,Arabidopsis|Computational Biology|Down-Regulation|Host Microbial Interactions|Plant Diseases|Plant Viral Movement Proteins|Plant Viruses|Salinity,D017360|D019295|D015536|D000076662|D010935|D053830|D010942|D054712,Alfalfa mosaic virus|Artificial microRNA|Caulimovirus|Cell-to-cell movement|Endogenous viral elements|Movement protein

To showcase evolutionary and epidemiological relationships associated with silent, adaptive synonymous changes of viruses, we used codon usage tables from human housekeeping and antiviral immune genes, as well as tables from arthropod vectors and vertebrate species involved in the flavivirus maintenance cycle. We argue that temporal trends of CAI changes could lead to a better understanding of zoonotic emergences, evolutionary dynamics, and host adaptation.

Currently, the molecular mechanisms that lead to virus extinction through enhanced mutagenesis are not fully understood. Increasing experimental evidence supports the lethal defection model of lethal mutagenesis of RNA viruses, where replication-competent-defectors drive infective virus towards extinction. Here, we address lethal mutagenesis in vivo using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) during the establishment of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) systemic infections in N. tabacum. The results show that 5-FU decreased the infectivity of TMV without affecting its viral load. Analysis of molecular clones spanning two genomic regions showed an increase of the FU-related base transitions AâââG and UâââC. Although the mutation frequency or the number of mutations per molecule did not increase, the complexity of the mutant spectra and the distribution of the mutations were altered. Overall, our results suggest that 5-FU antiviral effect on TMV is associated with the perturbation of the mutation-selection balance in the genomic region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Our work supports the lethal defection model for lethal mutagenesis in vivo in a plant RNA virus and opens the way to study lethal mutagens in plant-virus systems.",eng,2018,01,23,2018,1,25,epublish,Fluorouracil|Plant Diseases|Point Mutation|RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Viral Load|Viral Proteins|Virulence,D005472|D010935|D017354|D012324|D014026|D014027|D019562|D014764|D014774,

However, there is still limited information regarding the molecular mechanism underlying the development of the symptoms. In this study, the coat protein (CP) was confirmed as the symptom determinant by exchanging the CP between a chlorosis inducing CMV-M strain and a green-mosaic inducing CMV-Q strain. A yeast two-hybrid analysis and bimolecular fluorescence complementation revealed that the chloroplast ferredoxin I (Fd I) protein interacted with the CP of CMV-M both in vitro and in vivo, but not with the CP of CMV-Q. The severity of chlorosis was directly related to the expression of Fd1, that was down-regulated in CMV-M but not in CMV-Q. Moreover, the silencing of Fd I induced chlorosis symptoms that were similar to those elicited by CMV-M. Subsequent analyses indicated that the CP of CMV-M interacted with the precursor of Fd I in the cytoplasm and disrupted the transport of Fd I into chloroplasts, leading to the suppression of Fd I functions during a viral infection.

The engineered functional groups of cysteine and histidine in the TMVCP and the self-assembly conditions determine the thermodynamics and kinetics in the self-assembly process for forming different crystal structures.

In our previous study, microarray transcriptomes between leaves with trichomes and leaves without trichomes showed that an NtCBTS2 gene was expressed exclusively and abundantly in trichomes. Here, two NtCBTS2 isogenes (NtCBTS2a and NtCBTS2b), derived from a diploid genome donor, Nicotiana sylvestris, were identified from N. tabacum. Both genes were expressed primarily in trichomes, with relatively decreased transcription in ï¬owers and stems, and faint expression in roots, and no expression was detected in leaves lacking trichomes. To demonstrate the feasibility of producing natural product cembratrien-ols in tobacco mesophylls, the mesophylls of 35S:NtCBTS2b transgenic tobacco plants were used in the analysis, suggesting that constitutive expression of NtCBTS2b led to the cembratrien-ol production in mesophylls. Overexpression of NtCBTS2b using either Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S or trichome-specific Cyt P450 oxygenase (CYP) promoters greatly increased aphid resistance by promoting the accumulation of CBT-ols, increased the secretory cell growth in glandular trichomes and increased the levels of various physiological measures, including sugar esters, gibberellins, and cembranoid production. Meanwhile, specifically overexpressing NtCBTS2b in glandular trichomes could most efficiently promote aphid resistance in tobacco plants.

The integration of biomaterials with 3-D microdevice components offers exciting opportunities for communities developing miniature bioelectronics with enhanced performance and advanced modes of operation. However, most biological materials are stable only in properly conditioned aqueous solutions, thus the water-repellent properties exhibited by densely arranged micro/nanostructures (widely known as the Cassie-Baxter state) represent a significant challenge to biomaterial integration. Here, we first investigate such potential limitations using cysteine-modified tobacco mosaic virus (TMV1cys) as a model bionanoreceptor and a set of Au-coated Si-micropillar arrays (Î¼PAs) of varying densities. Furthermore, we introduce a novel biofabrication system adopting electrowetting principles for the controlled localization of TMV1cys bionanoreptors on densely arranged Î¼PAs. Contact angle analysis and SEM characterizations provide clear evidence to indicate structural hydrophobicity as a key limiting factor for 3-D biofunctionalization and for electrowetting as an effective method to overcome this limitation. The successful 3-D biofabrication is confirmed using SEM and fluorescence microscopy that show spatially controlled and uniform assemblies of TMV1cys on Î¼PAs. The increased density of TMV1cys per device footprint produces a 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity attributed to the Î¼PAs when compared to similar assemblies on planar substrates. Combined, this work demonstrates the potential of electrowetting as a unique enabling solution for the controlled and efficient biofabrication of 3-D-patterned micro/nanodomains.",eng,2018,01,18,2018,1,5,ppublish,,,

Fitness costs are associated with plant NLR genes and regulation of NLR genes by micro(mi)RNAs and phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNA) is proposed as a mechanism for reducing these fitness costs. However, whether NLR expression and NLR-mediated immunity are regulated during plant growth is unclear. We conducted genome-wide transcriptome analysis and showed that NLR expression gradually increased while expression of their regulatory small RNAs (sRNA) gradually decreased as plants matured, indicating that sRNAs could play a role in regulating NLR expression during plant growth. We further tested the role of miRNA in the growth regulation of NLRs using the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) resistance gene N, which was targeted by miR6019 and miR6020. We showed that N-mediated resistance to TMV effectively restricted this virus to the infected leaves of 6-week old plants, whereas TMV infection was lethal in 1- and 3-week old seedlings due to virus-induced systemic necrosis. We further found that N transcript levels gradually increased while miR6019 levels gradually decreased during seedling maturation that occurs in the weeks after germination. Analyses of reporter genes in transgenic plants showed that growth regulation of N expression was post-transcriptionally mediated by MIR6019/6020 whereas MIR6019/6020 was regulated at the transcriptional level during plant growth. TMV infection of MIR6019/6020 transgenic plants indicated a key role for miR6019-triggered phasiRNA production for regulation of N-mediated immunity.

The M strain of cucumber mosaic virus (M-CMV) has six distinct symptoms: vein clearing, mosaic, chlorosis, partial green recovery, complete green recovery, and secondary mosaic. Chlorosis indicates the loss of chlorophyll which is highly abundant in plant leaves and plays essential roles in photosynthesis. Blue native/SDS-PAGE combined with mass spectrum was performed to detect the location of virus, and proteomic analysis of chloroplast isolated from virus-infected plants was performed to quantify the changes of individual proteins in order to gain a global view of the total chloroplast protein dynamics during the virus infection. Among the 438 proteins quantified, 33 showed a more than twofold change in abundance, of which 22 are involved in the light-dependent reactions and five in the Calvin cycle. The dynamic change of these proteins indicates that light-dependent reactions are down-accumulated, and the Calvin cycle was up-accumulated during virus infection. In addition to the proteins involved in photosynthesis, tubulin was up-accumulated in virus-infected plant, which might contribute to the autophagic process during plant infection.

This lack of effective antiviral agents is mainly due to the poor understanding of potential targets associated with TMV infections. During infection, the coat protein (CP), which is delivered by viral particles into susceptible host cells, provides protection for viral RNA. Here, we found that Ningnanmycin (NNM), a commercially used plant antibacterial agent, inhibits the assembly of the CP by directly binding several residues. These interactions cause the disassembly of the CP from discs into monomers, leading to an almost complete loss of pathogenicity.

Besides the fungal and bacterial diseases, the crop is reported to be infected by tobacco mosaic virus, beet western yellows virus and turnip mosaic virus under experimental condition. Till now, there was no report of natural infection of any begomovirus in this crop. In the present study, a leaf curl disease was observed in germplasm accessions of three species of Crambe (C. abyssinica, C. glabrata and C. hispanica). Based on the symptoms and presence of whitefly population in the field, begomovirus infection was suspected. Molecular characterization through RCA approach, indicated presence of croton yellow vein mosaic virus (CYVMV, KJ747958) and croton yellow vein mosaic betasatellite (CroYVMB, KM229762). Co-agroinoculation of partial dimeric construct of CYVMV with complete dimeric construct of CroYVMB, produced typical leaf curl symptoms in C. abyssinica, whereas, agroinoculation of partial dimeric construct of CYVMV alone could not produce symptoms in the same plant. In contrast, the CYVMV construct alone could produce symptom in Nicotiana benthamiana, a model host for plant virus studies. In N. benthamiana co-inoculation of CroYVMV with CYVMV construct develop more severe symptoms. However, neither the CYVMV construct alone nor the co-inoculation with CroYVMB produce any symptom in Arabidopsis thaliana even with different methods of inoculation. Inoculated Arabidopsis thaliana also did not yield any amplification of the virus as assessed through PCR and rolling circle amplification (RCA). Thus it confirmed that for successful infection in crambe, CYVMV requires betasatellite, while in N. benthamiana, it does not require betasatellite for symptom induction and in Arabidopsis thaliana CYVMV alone or in presence of betasatellite did not replicate and produce any symptom.

These results demonstrated the increased tolerance of OE plants to salt stress compared with the WT. The OE plants had lower osmotic potential (OP), reduced Na+ toxicity and less reactive oxygen species accumulation compared with the WT, which may be related to their higher level of osmolytes, lower Na+/K+ ratio and higher antioxidant enzyme activities under salt stress conditions.

In addition, our data suggested that the changes of virus accumulation in response to EXPA4 expression levels could further affect the antioxidative metabolism and phytohormone-related pathways in tobacco induced by virus inoculation. EXPA4-silenced plants with TMV-GFP have enhanced antioxidant enzymes activities, which were down-regulated in virus-inoculated 35S:EXPA4 plants. Salicylic acid accumulation and SA-mediated defence genes induced by TMV-GFP were up-regulated in EXPA4-silenced plants, but depressed in 35S:EXPA4 plants. Furthermore, a VIGS approach was used in combination with exogenous phytohormone treatments, suggesting that EXPA4 has different responses to different phytohormones. Taken together, these results suggested that EXPA4 plays a role in tobacco defence against viral pathogens.",eng,2017,10,09,2017,10,11,ppublish,"Antioxidants|Gene Expression|Gene Silencing|Genes, Reporter|Plant Diseases|Plant Growth Regulators|Plant Immunity|Plant Proteins|Salicylic Acid|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D000975|D015870|D020868|D017930|D010935|D010937|D057865|D010940|D020156|D014026|D014027,Antioxidative metabolism|Expansins|Phytohormone|Plant defence

We investigated whether one of the genes upregulated in Nicotiana benthamiana after Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) inoculation was involved in regulating virus movement. We revealed the gene to be a plasma membrane-associated cation-binding protein 1-like protein, designated NbPCaP1L. The expression of NbPCaP1L in N. benthamiana was knocked down using Tobacco rattle virus-based gene silencing and consequently the accumulation of BaMV increased significantly to that of control plants. Further analysis indicated no significant difference in the accumulation of BaMV in NbPCaP1L knockdown and control protoplasts, suggesting NbPCaP1L may affect cell-to-cell movement of BaMV. Using a viral vector expressing green fluorescent protein in the knockdown plants, the mean area of viral focus, as determined by fluorescence, was found to be larger in NbPCaP1L knockdown plants. Orange fluorescence protein (OFP)-fused NbPCaP1L, NbPCaP1L-OFP, was expressed in N. benthamiana and reduced the accumulation of BaMV to 46%. To reveal the possible interaction of viral protein with NbPCaP1L, we performed yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicated that NbPCaP1L interacted with BaMV replicase. The results also suggested that NbPCaP1L could trap the BaMV movement RNP complex via interaction with the viral replicase in the complex and so restricted viral cell-to-cell movement.",eng,,,,2017,10,11,ppublish,Calcium-Binding Proteins|Cell Membrane|Gene Knockdown Techniques|Plant Proteins|Potexvirus|Protoplasts|Tobacco|Up-Regulation,D002135|D002462|D055785|D010940|D017863|D011523|D014026|D015854,Bamboo mosaic virus|NbPCaP1L|Nicotiana benthamiana|defense protein|positive-sense RNA virus|replicase|viral RNA movement

Here, we cloned the cytoplasmic Xrn4 gene of Oryza sativa (OsXrn4), and demonstrated that its over-expression elevated the 5'-3' exoribonuclease activity in rice plants and conferred resistance to rice stripe virus, a negative-sense RNA virus causing serious losses in East Asia. The accumulation of viral RNAs was also decreased. Moreover, the ectopic expression of OsXrn4 in N. benthamiana also conferred plant resistance to tobacco mosaic virus infection.

Viral intercellular movement occurs through PD. To better understand the involvement of PD in viral infection, we conducted a quantitative proteomic study on the PD-enriched fraction from Nicotiana benthamiana leaves in response to infection by Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). We report the identification of a total of 1070 PD protein candidates, of which 100 (â¥2-fold increase) and 48 (â¥2-fold reduction) are significantly differentially accumulated in the PD-enriched fraction, when compared with protein levels in the corresponding healthy control. Among the differentially accumulated PD protein candidates, we show that an Î±-expansin designated NbEXPA1, a cell wall loosening protein, is PD-specific. TuMV infection downregulates NbEXPA1 mRNA expression and protein accumulation. We further demonstrate that NbEXPA1 is recruited to the viral replication complex via the interaction with NIb, the only RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of TuMV. Silencing of NbEXPA1 inhibits plant growth and TuMV infection, whereas overexpression of NbEXPA1 promotes viral replication and intercellular movement. These data suggest that NbEXPA1 is a host factor for potyviral infection.

Beyond classically explored molecular self-assembly, structure formation in the nanoparticle and colloidal length scales have recently been actively explored for new functions. Structure of colloidal assemblies depends strongly on the assembly process, and higher structural control can be reliably achieved only if the process is deterministic. Here we show that self-assembly of cationic spherical metal nanoparticles and anionic rod-like viruses yields well-defined binary superlattice wires. The superlattice structures are explained by a cooperative assembly pathway that proceeds in a zipper-like manner after nucleation. Curiously, the formed superstructure shows right-handed helical twisting due to the right-handed structure of the virus. This leads to structure-dependent chiral plasmonic function of the material. The work highlights the importance of well-defined colloidal units when pursuing unforeseen and complex assemblies.Colloidal self-assembly is a unique method to produce three-dimensional materials with well-defined hierarchical structures and functionalities.

While reperfusion therapy with thrombolytic agents reduces mortality from acute myocardial infarction and disability from stroke, thrombolysis is generally less effective than mechanical reperfusion and is associated with fatal intracerebral hemorrhage in up to 2-5% of patients. To address these limitations, we propose the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-based platform technology for targeted delivery of thrombolytic therapies. TMV is a plant virus-based nanoparticle with a high aspect ratio shape measuring 300 Ã 18 nm. These soft matter nanorods have favorable flow and margination properties allowing the targeting of the diseased vessel wall. We have previously shown that TMV homes to thrombi in a photochemical mouse model of arterial thrombosis. Here we report the synthesis of TMV conjugates loaded with streptokinase (STK). Various TMV-STK formulations were produced through bioconjugation of STK to TMV via intervening PEG linkers. TMV-STK was characterized using SDS-PAGE and Western blot, transmission electron microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, and cryo-electron tomography. We investigated the thrombolytic activity of TMV-STK in vitro using static phantom clots, and in a physiologically relevant hydrodynamic model of shear-induced thrombosis. Our findings demonstrate that conjugation of STK to the TMV surface does not compromise the activity of STK. Moreover, the nanoparticle conjugate significantly enhances thrombolysis under flow conditions, which can likely be attributed to TMV's shape-mediated flow properties resulting in enhanced thrombus accumulation and dissolution. Together, these data suggest TMV to be a promising platform for the delivery of thrombolytics to enhance clot localization and potentially minimize bleeding risk.",eng,2017,09,26,2017,9,8,ppublish,"Blotting, Western|Drug Delivery Systems|Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel|Fibrinolytic Agents|Nanoparticles|Plant Viruses|Plasminogen|Thrombolytic Therapy|Thrombosis|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D015153|D016503|D004591|D005343|D053758|D010942|D010958|D015912|D013927|D014027,cardiovascular disease|drug delivery|plasminogen activator|streptokinase (STK)|thrombosis|tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)

Here, we show that TGB1 localizes to the nucleus and the nucleolus, as well as the cytoplasm, and that TGB1 nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking is required for BSMV cell-to-cell movement. Prediction analyses and laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) experiments verified that TGB1 possesses a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) (amino acids 95-104) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (amino acids 227-238). NoLS mutations reduced BSMV cell-to-cell movement significantly, whereas NLS mutations almost completely abolished movement. Furthermore, neither the NoLS nor NLS mutant viruses could infect Nicotiana benthamiana systemically, although the NoLS mutant virus was able to establish systemic infections of barley. Protein interaction experiments demonstrated that TGB1 interacts directly with the glycine-arginine-rich (GAR) domain of the nucleolar protein fibrillarin (Fib2). Moreover, in BSMV-infected cells, Fib2 accumulation increased by about 60%-70% and co-localized with TGB1 in the plasmodesmata. In addition, BSMV cell-to-cell movement in fib2 knockdown transgenic plants was reduced to less than one-third of that of non-transgenic plants. Fib2 also co-localized with both TGB1 and BSMV RNA, which are the main components of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) movement complex.

Whereas Pd transport of small molecules, such as ions and water, is presumed to occur passively, cell-to-cell transport of biological macromolecules, such proteins, most likely occurs via an active mechanism that involves specific targeting signals on the transported molecule. The scarcity of identified plasmodesmata (Pd) localization signals (PLSs) has severely restricted the understanding of protein-sorting pathways involved in plant cell-to-cell macromolecular transport and communication. From a wealth of plant endogenous and viral proteins known to traffic through Pd, only three PLSs have been reported to date, all of them from endogenous plant proteins. Thus, it is important to develop a reliable and systematic experimental strategy to identify a functional PLS sequence, that is both necessary and sufficient for Pd targeting, directly in the living plant cells. Here, we describe one such strategy using as a paradigm the cell-to-cell movement protein (MP) of the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).

In this report, 12 host proteins were identified as CMV LS2b binding partners using the yeast two-hybrid screen system from the Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library. Among the host proteins, 30S ribosomal subunit protein S11 (RPS11) was selected for further studies. The interaction between LS2b and full-length RPS11 was confirmed using the yeast two-hybrid system. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) assays observed by confocal laser microscopy and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays were used to verify the interaction between endogenous NbRPS11 and viral CMVLS2b both in vivo and in vitro. TRV-based gene silencing vector was used to knockdown NbRPS11 transcription, and immunoblot analysis revealed a decline in infectious viral RNA replication and a decrease in CMV infection in RPS11 down-regulated Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Thus, the knockdown of RPS11 likely inhibited CMV replication and accumulation. The gene silencing suppressor activity of CMV2b protein was reduced by the RPS11 knockdown.

In many cases chronic symptoms and long-term virus recovery occur, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we found that wild-type Cucumber mosaic virus (CMVWT) invaded the SAM transiently, but was subsequently eliminated from the meristems. Unexpectedly, a CMV mutant, designated CMVRA that harbors an alanine substitution in the N-terminal arginine-rich region of the coat protein (CP) persistently invaded the SAM and resulted in visible reductions in apical dominance. Notably, the CMVWT virus elicited more potent antiviral silencing than CMVRA in newly emerging leaves of infected plants. However, both viruses caused severe symptoms with minimal antiviral silencing effects in the Arabidopsis mutants lacking host RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) or SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3), indicating that CMVWT induced host RDR6/SGS3-dependent antiviral silencing. We also showed that reduced accumulation of the 2b protein is elicited in the CMVWT infection and consequently rescues potent antiviral RNA silencing. Indeed, co-infiltration assays showed that the suppression of posttranscriptional gene silencing mediated by 2b is more severely compromised by co-expression of CPWT than by CPRA. We further demonstrated that CPWT had high RNA binding activity leading to translation inhibition in wheat germ systems, and CPWT was associated with SGS3 into punctate granules in vivo. Thus, we propose that the RNAs bound and protected by CPWT possibly serve as templates of RDR6/SGS3 complexes for siRNA amplification. Together, these findings suggest that the CMV CP acts as a central hub that modulates antiviral silencing and VSRs activity, and mediates viral self-attenuation and long-term symptom recovery.",eng,2017,07,20,2017,7,21,epublish,Arabidopsis|Arabidopsis Proteins|Capsid Proteins|Cucumovirus|Gene Silencing|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|RNA Interference|Tobacco|Viral Proteins,D017360|D029681|D036022|D017799|D020868|D010935|D018515|D034622|D014026|D014764,

Here we report characterization of a MAP kinase (VmMAPK1), which was induced upon MYMIV-inoculation in resistant V. mungo. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that VmMAPK1 is closely related to other plant-stress-responsive MAPKs. Both mRNA and protein of VmMAPK1 were accumulated upon MYMIV infection. The VmMAPK1 protein localized in the nucleus as well as cytoplasm and possessed phosphorylation activity in vitro. A detailed biochemical characterization of purified recombinant VmMAPK1 demonstrated an intramolecular mechanism of autophosphorylation and self-catalyzed phosphate incorporation on both threonine and tyrosine residues.

In order to successfully produce recombinant JgCSMV-derived VLPs, we followed an approach based on cloning of the JgCSMV CP gene into pBI121 vector and introduction of the latter into Agrobacterium rhizogenes and transformation of tobacco cells for coat protein expression. Expression in tobacco tissue was demonstrated in transformed hairy roots as a model system. Recombinant VLPs were purified, analyzed by immune assay and visulalized by electron microscopy. Next, we explored the possibility of using JgCSMV-derived VLPs as a nanocontainer for loading the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), taking advantage of the reversible swelling of VLPs in vitro. The results showed that transformed hairy roots produced high levels of the recombinant protein that readily assembled to form empty shells with overall structure similar to native virus particles. In addition, we demonstrated that JgCSMV-VLPs could function as vehicles able to load the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin.

Several hypotheses suggest benefits that should outweigh the costs of a reduced transmission efficiency and of segregation of coadapted genes associated with encapsidating each segment into a different particle. Advantages range from increasing genome size despite high mutation rates, faster replication, more efficient selection resulting from reassortment during mixed infections, better regulation of gene expression, or enhanced virion stability and cell-to-cell movement. However, support for these hypotheses is scarce. Here we report experiments testing whether an evolutionary stable equilibrium exists for the three genomic RNAs of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV). Starting infections with different segment combinations, we found that the relative abundance of each segment evolves towards a constant ratio. Population genetic analyses show that the segment ratio at this equilibrium is determined by frequency-dependent selection. Replication of RNAs 1 and 2 was coupled and collaborative, whereas the replication of RNA 3 interfered with the replication of the other two. We found that the equilibrium solution is slightly different for the total amounts of RNA produced and encapsidated, suggesting that competition exists between all RNAs during encapsidation.

Four genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of S. pneumoniae type 2 polysaccharide were assembled into a single expression cassette as a large polyprotein driven by a single cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter.

Numerous studies have suggested that MPs use a pathway either through the ER or through the plasma membrane (PM). Furthermore, recent studies reported that ER-PM contact sites and PM microdomains, which are subdomains found in the ER and PM, are involved in virus cell-to-cell movement. However, functional relationship of these subdomains in MP traffic to PD has not been described previously. We demonstrate here the intracellular trafficking of fig mosaic virus MP (MPFMV) using live cell imaging, focusing on its ER-directing signal peptide (SPFMV). Transiently expressed MPFMV was distributed predominantly in PD and patchy microdomains of the PM. Investigation of ER translocation efficiency revealed that SPFMV has quite low efficiency compared with SPs of well-characterized plant proteins, calreticulin and CLAVATA3. An MPFMV mutant lacking SPFMV localized exclusively to the PM microdomains, whereas SP chimeras, in which the SP of MPFMV was replaced by an SP of calreticulin or CLAVATA3, localized exclusively to the nodes of the ER, which was labeled with Arabidopsis synaptotagmin 1, a major component of ER-PM contact sites. From these results, we speculated that the low translocation efficiency of SPFMV contributes to the generation of ER-translocated and the microdomain-localized populations, both of which are necessary for PD localization. Consistent with this hypothesis, SP-deficient MPFMV became localized to PD when co-expressed with an SP chimera. Here we propose a new model for the intracellular trafficking of a viral MP. A substantial portion of MPFMV that fails to be translocated is transferred to the microdomains, whereas the remainder of MPFMV that is successfully translocated into the ER subsequently localizes to ER-PM contact sites and plays an important role in the entry of the microdomain-localized MPFMV into PD.",eng,2017,06,22,2017,6,24,epublish,Arabidopsis|Cell Membrane|Endoplasmic Reticulum|Membrane Microdomains|Microtubules|Plant Viral Movement Proteins|Plasmodesmata|Protein Transport|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D017360|D002462|D004721|D021962|D008870|D053830|D031425|D021381|D014026|D014027,

Down-regulation of a new gene referred to as NbAGO5L showed some reduced silencing for TGdP19 but not for the other two virus constructs, whereas silencing of NbAGO7 gave rise to a subtle increase in susceptibility to all three viruses. Co-infiltrating different TRV-NbAGO constructs simultaneously did not enhance virus susceptibility. However, an unexpected finding was that whenever the TRV-NbAGO1 construct was present, this compromised silencing of genes targeted by co-infiltrated constructs, as shown upon co-infiltration of TRV-NbAGO1 with either TRV-NbAGO2 or TRV-Sul (targeting Magnesium chelatase I). Only after a prolonged period (approximately 2 months) did TRV-Sul-mediated systemic bleaching occur in these co-infected plants, suggesting that TRV-NbAGO1 hinders the silencing ability of other TRV-NbAGO constructs.

In this study, oleic acid was separated from cottonseed oil sludge by antiviral bioassay-guided methods. Antiviral activity of FAs was compared with that of Ningnanmycin. Subsequently, effects of FAs on defense-related enzymes (PAL, POD) and defense-related genes (PR-1a, PR-5) were studied. FAs presented moderate antiviral activity, which is close to that of Ningnanmycin, and activities of PAL and POD were higher in oleic-acid-treated tobacco leaves than those inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and water-treated tobacco. In oleic-acid-treated tobacco, expression levels of PR-1a and PR-5 genes rapidly increased from days 1-3. All results showed that FAs can increase resistance against TMV, and related mechanism can be attributed to activated expressions of a number of defense-related genes, suggesting that FAs can potentially act as pesticides for integrated control of plant viruses in the future.",eng,2017,05,10,2017,6,10,ppublish,Antiviral Agents|Cytidine|Fatty Acids|Oleic Acid|Plant Proteins|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D000998|D003562|D005227|D019301|D010940|D014026|D014027,Antiviral|Fatty acids|Tobacco mosaic virus

The association between NOA1 and NO accumulation in Arabidopsis noa1 mutants has been linked to the inability of noa1 mutants to accumulate carbon reserves such as fumarate, leading to chloroplast dysfunction and a pale green leaf phenotype. To understand the role played by NOA1 in response to South African cassava mosaic virus infection in Nicotiana benthamiana, the expression of NbNOA1 and the accumulation of NO in leaf samples was compared between south african cassava mosaic (SACMV)-infected and mock-infected plants at 14 and 28 dpi. Real-time qPCR was used to measure SACMV viral load which increased significantly by 20% from 14 to 28 dpi as chlorosis and symptom severity progressed. At 14 and 28 dpi, NbNOA1 expression was significantly lower than mock inoculated plants (2-fold lower at 14 dpi, p-value=0.01 and 5-fold lower at 28, p-value=0.00). At 14 dpi, NO accumulation remained unchanged in infected leaf tissue compared to mock inoculated, while at 28 dpi, NO accumulation was 40% lower (p-value=0.01). At 28 dpi, the decrease in NbNOA1 expression and NO accumulation was accompanied by chloroplast dysfunction, evident from the significant reduction in chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids in SACMV-infected leaves. Furthermore, the expression of chloroplast translation factors (chloroplast RNA binding, chloroplast elongation factor G, translation elongation factor Tu, translation initiation factor 3-2, plastid-specific ribosomal protein 6 and plastid ribosome recycling factor) were found to be repressed in infected N. benthamiana. GC-MS analysis showed a decrease in fumarate and an increase in glucose in SACMV-infected N. benthamiana in comparison to mock samples suggesting a decrease in carbon stores. Collectively, these results provide evidence that in response to SACMV infection, a decrease in photopigments and carbon stores, accompanied by an increase in glucose and decrease in fumarate, leads to a decline in NbNOA1expression and NO levels. This is manifested by suppressed translation factors and disruption of chloroplast function, thereby contributing to chlorotic disease symptoms.",eng,2017,05,31,2017,6,5,ppublish,Begomovirus|Chloroplasts|Gene Expression Profiling|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Nitric Oxide|Nitric Oxide Synthase|Plant Diseases|Plant Proteins|Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship|Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction|Tobacco,D053839|D002736|D020869|D054884|D009569|D019001|D010935|D010940|D021281|D060888|D014026,Chloroplast|Disease symptoms|Fumarate|NOA1|Nitric oxide|South African cassava mosaic virus

Furthermore, tobacco mosaic virus was recently shown to replicate in a filamentous ascomycetous fungus. Thus, at least experimentally, some plant viruses can infect some fungi. Endophytic fungi have been reported from many plants and several of these fungi have been shown to contain viruses. Here we tested if mycoviruses derived from a marine plant endophyte can replicate in plant cells. For this purpose, we used partially purified viral particles from isolate MUT4330 of Penicillium aurantiogriseum var. viridicatum which harbors six virus species, some having dsRNA and some positive-strand ssRNA genomes. These were transfected into three distinct plant protoplast cell systems.

Previous studies confirmed that there are significant differences between DGIs and LGTs in terms of physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology, but the mechanisms by which DGIs form remain unclear. To investigate the global gene expression changes that occur in these special tissues, individual differential gene expression tag libraries were constructed from three total RNA samples isolated from DGIs, LGTs and control plants (CK) and were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeqTM 2000. An analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed. These analyses revealed the differences between DGIs, LGTs and CK. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses suggested that several pathways related to photosynthesis and chlorophyll metabolism were enriched in DGIs compared to LGTs and CK. Several pathways related to apoptosis were significantly up-regulated in LGTs compared to DGIs. Additionally, we identified sets of DEGs that may be related to the formation or development of DGIs and LGTs.

To understand the molecular mechanisms of chlorosis in this viroid disease, we established an experimental system suitable for studying the mechanism underlying the chlorosis induced by the RNA silencing of Hsp90C in transgenic tobacco. Hairpin RNA of the Hsp90C-specific region was expressed under the control of a dexamethasone-inducible promoter, resulted in the silencing of Hsp90C gene in 2Â days and the chlorosis along with growth suppression phenotypes.

In this study, we provide several lines of evidence to reveal the determining role of a protein of the Nicotiana benthamiana chloroplast Hsp70 (NbcpHsp70) family, NbcpHsp70-2, involved in the preference of Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) to infect older tissues. NbcpHsp70 family proteins were identified in complexes pulled down with BaMV replicase as the bait. Among the isoforms of NbcpHsp70, only the specific silencing of NbcpHsp70-2 resulted in the significant decrease of BaMV RNA in N. benthamiana protopalsts, indicating that NbcpHsp70-2 is involved in the efficient replication of BaMV RNA. We further identified the age-dependent import regulation signal contained in the transit peptide of NbcpHsp70-2. Deletion, overexpression, and substitution experiments revealed that the signal in the transit peptide of NbcpHsp70-2 is crucial for both the import of NbcpHsp70-2 into older chloroplasts and the preference of BaMV for infecting older leaves of N. benthamiana.

In host range studies, some differential responses in host plants were also identified between ToMMV and ToMV. To alleviate cross-serological reactivity among the tomato-infecting tobamoviruses, a new multiplex RT-PCR was developed to allow for species-specific detection and identification of TMV, ToMV, and ToMMV. In addition, we observed resistance breaking by ToMMV on selected tomato cultivars that were resistant to ToMV. This has caused serious concerns to tomato growers worldwide. In conclusion, the characterization in molecular and biological properties of ToMMV would provide us with fundamental knowledge to manage this emerging virus on tomato and other solanaceous crops in the U.S. and around the world.",eng,2017,03,07,2017,5,1,ppublish,,,

FHV protein A was engineered to target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via a heterologous tobacco etch virus ER-targeting domain, and was expressed in cis or in trans relative to the replicating FHV RNA1. A strong increase in marker gene expression in plants was noted when ER-targeted protein A was supplied in trans.

Increased expression of RPS6 was detected in Nicotiana benthamiana during infection by diverse plant viruses. Silencing of the RPS6 and S6K genes in N. benthamiana affected accumulation of Cucumber mosaic virus, Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), and Potato virus A (PVA) in contrast to Turnip crinkle virus and Tobacco mosaic virus. In addition, the viral genome-linked protein (VPg) of TuMV and PVA interacted with S6K in plant cells, as detected by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay. The VPg-S6K interaction was detected in cytoplasm, nucleus, and nucleolus, whereas the green fluorescent protein-tagged S6K alone showed cytoplasmic localization only. These results demonstrate that the requirement for RPS6 and S6K differs for diverse plant viruses with different translation initiation strategies and suggest that potyviral VPg-S6K interaction may affect S6K functions in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.",eng,2017,04,24,2017,4,25,ppublish,"Arabidopsis|Arabidopsis Proteins|Cell Nucleolus|Cell Nucleus|Gene Silencing|Genome, Viral|Green Fluorescent Proteins|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Phenotype|Plant Epidermis|Potyvirus|Protein Binding|Ribosomal Protein S6|Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases|Solanum tuberosum|Subcellular Fractions|Tobacco|Viral Proteins",D017360|D029681|D002466|D002467|D020868|D016679|D049452|D054884|D010641|D019441|D017800|D011485|D038601|D019893|D011198|D013347|D014026|D014764,

Here, we show that a Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) can be split, and that split-SaCas9 expressed from Agrobacterium can induce targeted mutagenesis in Nicotiana benthamiana. Since SaCas9 is smaller than the more commonly used Cas9 derived from Streptococcus pyogenes, the split-SaCas9 provides the smallest tool yet for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) plant genome editing. Both sets of split-SaCas9 (_430N/431C and _739N/740C) exhibited genome-editing activity, and the activity of split-SaCas9_739N/740C was almost the same as that of full-length SaCas9. This result indicates that split-SaCas9_739N/740C is suitable for use in targeted mutagenesis. We also show that the split-SaCas9 fragment expressed from Tomato mosaic virus could induce targeted mutagenesis together with another fragment expressed from Agrobacterium, suggesting that a split-SaCas9 system using a plant virus vector is a promising tool for integration-free plant genome editing.

In this study, both TaHSP70 and NbHSP70 were up-regulated in Chinese wheat mosaic furovirus (CWMV)-infected plants. Their overexpression and inhibition were correlated with the accumulation of viral genomic RNAs, suggesting that the HSP70 genes could be necessary for CWMV infection. The subcellular distributions of TaHSP70 and NbHSP70 were significantly affected by CWMV infection or by infiltration of RNA1 alone. Further assays showed that the viral replicase encoded by CWMV RNA1 interacts with both TaHSP70 and NbHSP70 in vivo and vitro and that its region aa167-333 was responsible for the interaction. Subcellular assays showed that the viral replicase could recruit both TaHSP70 and NbHSP70 from the cytoplasm or nucleus to the granular aggregations or inclusion-like structures on the intracellular membrane system, suggesting that both HSP70s may be recruited into the viral replication complex (VRC) to promote furoviral replication.

They were isolated from severely diseased plants during the last 30-40 years and include: Cassava common mosaic virus (CsCMV), Cassava Caribbean mosaic virus (CsCaMV), Cassava Colombian symptomless virus (CsCSV) and Cassava virus X (CsVX). However, their definitive classification as distinct species remains unresolved for several reasons, including the lack of sequence data and unavailability of samples from original isolates. This complicates disease diagnostics, cassava germplasm exchange certification, evaluation of virus cleaning protocols and epidemiological studies. Furthermore, a recently detected novel alphaflexivirus, indicates that cassava-infecting potexviruses may be more diverse. To solve the identity of these viruses, we started indexing samples from different parts of Colombia using different sets of PCR primers, antisera available and inoculation to indicator plants. Results show that there are three major phylogenetic groups of potexviruses infecting cassava, and they correspond to CsCMV, CsVX and the newly identified Cassava new alphaflexivirus (CsNAV). Bioassays and sequence analysis established that isolates of CsNAV and CsVX cause latent infections in different cassava landraces, they are not efficiently transmitted to the indicator plant Nicotiana benthamiana and they lack the gene 3 of the conserved potexviral 'triple gene block' (TGB). In contrast, all isolates of CsCMV (which have a characteristic potexvirus genome arrangement) caused Cassava Common Mosaic Disease (CCMD) in single infections and were efficiently transmitted to N. benthamiana.

As an example, the collective motion and mutual cooperation between complex protein machines mediate essential functions for life, such as replication, synthesis, degradation, repair and transport. Nucleic acid molecules are far less dynamic than proteins and need to bind to specific proteins to form hierarchical structures. The simplest example of these nucleic acid-based structures is provided by a rod-shaped tobacco mosaic virus, which consists of genetic material surrounded by coat proteins. Inspired by the complexity and hierarchical assembly of viruses, a great deal of effort has been devoted to design similarly constructed artificial viruses. However, such a wrapping approach makes nucleic acid dynamics insensitive to environmental changes. This limitation generally restricts, for example, the amplification of the conformational dynamics between the right-handed B form to the left-handed Z form of double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Here we report a virus-like hierarchical assembly in which the native DNA and a synthetic coat undergo repeated collective helicity switching triggered by pH change under physiological conditions.

The interactions between tobacco and P. nicotianae are complex and the outcomes of the interactions depend on the tobacco genotype, P. nicotianae strain, and environmental conditions. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) to investigate and compare transcriptional changes in the stems of tobacco upon inoculation with P. nicotianae strain race 0. We used two tobacco varieties: RBST (named from resistance to black shank and tobacco mosaic virus), which was resistant to the P. nicotianae strain race 0, and Honghuadajinyuan (HD), which was susceptible to P. nicotianae race 0. Samples were collected 12 and 72-hour post inoculation (hpi). Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and significantly enriched GO terms indicated that several basic defense mechanisms were suppressed in both varieties, which included response to wounding (GO: 0009611), and defense response to fungus (GO: 0050832). We also found some genes that may especially be related to mechanisms of resistance in RBST, such as the one encoding a chitinase.

However, to date, the regulatory mechanisms underlying auxin-mediated plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi symbiosis have not been well deciphered. Previously we identified a GH3 gene, SlGH3.4, strongly responsive to both auxin induction and mycorrhizal symbiosis. Here, we reported a refined dissection of the SlGH3.4 promoter activity using the Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter. The SlGH3.4 promoter could drive GUS expression strongly in mycorrhizal roots of soybean and rice plants, and in IAA-treated soybean roots, but not in IAA-treated rice roots. A promoter deletion assay revealed three cis-acting motifs, i.e. the auxin-responsive element, AuxRE, and two newly identified motifs named MYCRS1 and MYCRS2, involved in the activation of auxin- and AM-mediated expression of SlGH3.4. Deletion of the AuxRE from the SlGH3.4 promoter caused almost complete abolition of GUS staining in response to external IAA induction. Seven repeats of AuxRE fused to the Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S minimal promoter could direct GUS expression in both IAA-treated and AM fungal-colonized roots of tobacco plants. Four repeats of MYCRS1 or MYCRS2 fused to the CaMV35S minimal promoter was sufficient to drive GUS expression in arbuscule-containing cells, but not in IAA-treated tobacco roots.

In addition to sucking phloem sap, M. persicae also transmits Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) as a vector in a nonpersistent manner. At present, the infection mechanism remains unclear, especially the process of aphid virus acquisition. In this study, we isolated four M. persicae cuticle protein genes (MPCP1, MPCP2, MPCP4, and MPCP5) from M. persicae. The relative amount of the gene encoding Cucumber mosaic virus capsid protein (CMV CP) and the transcript levels of these four cuticle protein genes were investigated in aphid virus acquisition by feeding the tobacco preinfested by CMV. The relative expression of MPCP1, MPCP2, and MPCP4 were significantly higher than MPCP5 at 24âh after aphids feeding on virus-infested tobacco. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated that the protein encoded by MPCP4 gene was closely associated with the CMV CP through the direct interaction. Moreover, the ability of M. persicae to acquire CMV was suppressed by RNA interference of MPCP4. All these lines of evidence indicate that MPCP4, as a viral putative receptor in the stylet of aphid, plays an important role in aphid acquisition of CMV.",eng,,,,2017,3,24,ppublish,"Animals|Aphids|Capsid Proteins|Cucumovirus|Insect Proteins|Plant Diseases|Sequence Analysis, DNA",D000818|D001042|D036022|D017799|D019476|D010935|D017422,Cucumber mosaic virus|Myzus persicae|RNA interference|cuticular protein|yeast two-hybrid

We used two complementary in-solution RNA structure probing strategies (SHAPE-MaP and RING-MaP) to examine the structure of the RNA genome of satellite tobacco mosaic virus inside authentic virions and in a capsid-free state. Both RNA states feature similar three-domain architectures in which each major replicative function-translation, capsid coding, and genome synthesis-fall into distinct domains. There are, however, large conformational differences between the in-virion and capsid-free states, primarily in one arm of the central T domain. These data support a model in which the packaged capsid-bound RNA is constrained in a local high-energy conformation by the native capsid shell. The removal of the viral capsid then allows the RNA genome to relax into a more thermodynamically stable conformation.

The amino acid sequences of ORF6 proteins encoded by different tobamoviruses are highly divergent. The potential role of ORF6 proteins in replication of tobamoviruses still needs to be elucidated. In this study, using biochemical and immunological methods, we have shown that ORF6 peptide is accumulated after infection in case of two isolates of Tobacco mosaic virus strain U1 (TMV-U1 common and TMV-U1 isolate A15). Unlike virus particles accumulating in the cytoplasm, the product of the ORF6 gene is found mainly in nuclei, which correlates with previously published data about transient expression of ORF6 isolated from TMV-U1. Moreover, we present new data showing the presence of ORF6 genes in genomes of several tobamoviruses.

The influences of moisture content on spectral profile, signal stability and plasma parameters (temperature and electron density) were also analysed. The results revealed that moisture content in fresh tobacco leaves would worsen the stability of analysis, and have a detrimental effect on the classification results. Good classification results were achieved based on the data from both full spectrum and observed emission lines of dried leaves, approaching 97.2% and 88.9% in the prediction set, respectively.

The potyviral VRCs are induced by the second 6âkDa protein (6K2) and contain at least viral RNA and nuclear inclusion protein b. To date, no chloroplast protein has been identified to interact with 6K2 and involve in potyvirus replication. In this paper, we showed that the Photosystem II oxygen evolution complex protein of Nicotiana benthamiana (NbPsbO1) was a chloroplast protein interacting with 6K2 of Tobacco vein banding mosaic virus (TVBMV; genus Potyvirus) and present in the VRCs. The first 6âkDa protein (6K1) was recruited to VRCs by 6K2 but had no interaction with NbPSbO1. Knockdown of NbPsbO1 gene expression in N. benthamiana plants through virus-induced gene silencing significantly decreased the accumulation levels of TVBMV and another potyvirus Potato virus Y, but not Potato virus X of genus Potexvirus. Amino acid substitutions in 6K2 that disrupted its interaction with NbPsbO1 also affected the replication of TVBMV. NbPsbP1 and NbPsbQ1, two other components of the Photosystem II oxygen evolution complex had no interaction with 6K2 and no effect on TVBMV replication.

Previously, we demonstrated that infection with Turnip mosaic virus, a member of one of the largest families of plant-infecting viruses, increases vector attraction and reproduction on infected hosts. These changes were due to a single viral protein, NIa-Pro. Here we show that NIa-Pro responds to the presence of the aphid vector during infection by relocalizing to the vacuole. Remarkably, vacuolar localization is required for NIa-Pro's ability to enhance aphid reproduction on host plants, vacuole localization disappears when aphids are removed, and this phenomenon occurs for another potyvirus, Potato virus Y, suggesting a conserved role for the protein in vector-host interactions.

Computational methods ranging from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to coarse-grained normal-mode analyses based on simplified elastic networks provide a general framework to studying these dynamics. Despite recent successes in studying very large systems with up to a 100,000,000 atoms, those methods are currently limited to studying small- to medium-sized molecular systems due to computational limitations. One solution to circumvent these limitations is to reduce the size of the system under study. In this paper, we argue that coarse-graining, the standard approach to such size reduction, must define a hierarchy of models of decreasing sizes that are consistent with each other, i.e., that each model contains the information of the dynamics of its predecessor. We propose a new method, Decimate, for generating such a hierarchy within the context of elastic networks for normal-mode analysis. This method is based on the concept of the renormalization group developed in statistical physics. We highlight the details of its implementation, with a special focus on its scalability to large systems of up to millions of atoms. We illustrate its application on two large systems, the capsid of a virus and the ribosome translation complex. We show that highly decimated representations of those systems, containing down to 1% of their original number of atoms, still capture qualitatively and quantitatively their dynamics.

830,28141855,PloS one,The signal peptide-like segment of hpaXm is required for its association to the cell wall in transgenic tobacco plants.,10.1371/journal.pone.0170931,"Harpins, encoded by hrp (hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) genes of Gram-negative plant pathogens, are elicitors of hypersensitive response (HR). HpaXm is a novel harpin-like protein described from cotton leaf blight bacteria, Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum-a synonym of X. campestris pv. malvacearum (Smith 1901-1978). A putative signal peptide (1-MNSLNTQIGANSSFL-15) of hpaXm was predicted in the nitroxyl-terminal (N-terminal)by SignalP (SignalP 3.0 server). Here, we explored the function of the N-terminal leader peptide like segment of hpaXm using transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi nc.). Transgenic tobacco lines expressing the full-length hpaXm and the signal peptide-like segment-deleted mutant hpaXmÎLP were developed using transformation mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The target genes were confirmed integrated into the tobacco genomes and expressed normally. Using immune colloidal-gold detection technique, hpaXm protein was found to be transferred to the cytoplasm, the cell membrane, and organelles such as chloroplasts, mitochondria, and nucleus, as well as the cell wall. However, the deletion mutant hpaXmÎLP expressed in transgenic tobacco was found unable to cross the membrane to reach the cell wall. Additionally, soluble proteins extracted from plants transformed with hpaXm and hpaXmÎLP were bio-active. Defensive micro-HR induced by the transgene expression of hpaXm and hpaXmÎLP were observed on transgenic tobacco leaves. Disease resistance bioassays to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) showed that tobacco plants transformed with hpaXm and with hpaXmÎLP exhibited enhanced resistance to TMV. In summary, the N-terminal signal peptide-like segment (1-45 bp) in hpaXm sequence is not necessary for transgene expression, bioactivity of hpaXm and resistance to TMV in transgenic tobacco, but is required for the protein to be translocated to the cell wall.",eng,2017,01,31,2017,2,1,epublish,"Amino Acid Sequence|Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins|Base Sequence|Blotting, Southern|Cell Wall|Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel|Genome, Plant|Mutant Proteins|Plant Leaves|Plants, Genetically Modified|Polymerase Chain Reaction|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Protein Sorting Signals|Sequence Deletion|Solubility|Structure-Activity Relationship|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Transcription, Genetic|Xanthomonas",D000595|D001425|D001483|D015139|D002473|D004591|D018745|D050505|D018515|D030821|D016133|D011401|D021382|D017384|D012995|D013329|D014026|D014027|D014158|D014974,

On the other hand, strong selective constraints against increasing genome size are an impediment for HGT, rapidly purging horizontally transferred sequences and thereby potentially hindering evolutionary innovation. Here, we explore experimentally the evolutionary fate of viruses with simulated HGT events, using the plant RNA virus Tobacco etch virus (TEV), by separately introducing two functional, exogenous sequences to its genome. One of the events simulates the acquisition of a new function though HGT of a conserved AlkB domain, responsible for the repair of alkylation or methylation damage in many organisms. The other event simulates the acquisition of a sequence that duplicates an existing function, through HGT of the 2b RNA silencing suppressor from Cucumber mosaic virus. We then evolved these two viruses, tracked the maintenance of the horizontally transferred sequences over time, and for the final virus populations, sequenced their genome and measured viral fitness. We found that the AlkB domain was rapidly purged from the TEV genome, restoring fitness to wild-type levels. Conversely, the 2b gene was stably maintained and did not have a major impact on viral fitness. Moreover, we found that 2b is functional in TEV, as it provides a replicative advantage when the RNA silencing suppression domain of HC-Pro is mutated.

ASV1 has a single-stranded RNA genome of 10,845 nucleotides in length and contains five putative open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encodes a polypeptide of 2592 amino acids (aa) and contains four conserved domains: a viral RNA methyltransferase domain, an FtsJ-like methyltransferase domain, a viral RNA helicase domain and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain.

TMV-43A replicated slower than TMV and induced a non-lethal mosaic symptom in Nicotiana benthamiana. In this study, deep sequencing was performed to detect the differences of small RNA profiles between TMV- and TMV-43A-infected N. benthamiana. The results showed that TMV-43A produced lesser amount of virus-derived interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) than that of TMV. However, the distributions of vsiRNAs generation hotspots between TMV and TMV-43A were similar. Expression of genes related to small RNA biogenesis in TMV-43A-infected N. benthamiana was significantly lower than that of TMV, which leads to generation of lesser vsiRNAs. The expressions of host defense response genes were up-regulated after TMV infection, as compared to TMV-43A-infected plants. Host defense response to TMV-43A infection was lower than that to TMV.

In this work, we employ charged tobacco mosaic virus (TMV-wt and TMV-lys) nanoparticles in constructing multilayered fibrous networks via electrostatic layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition. In neutral aqueous media, TMV-wt assumes an anionic surface charge. TMV-wt was paired with a genetically engineered TMV-lys variant that displays a corona of lysine side chains on its solvent-exposed surface. The electrostatic interaction between TMV-wt and TMV-lys nanoparticles became the driving force in the highly controlled buildup of the multilayer TMV constructs.

The detailed mechanism governing RNA silencing efficiency triggered by viruses is largely unclear. Here, we reveal that a petunia (Petunia hybrida) ocs element binding factor, PhOBF1, one of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, was up-regulated by Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) infection. Simultaneous silencing of PhOBF1 and a reporter gene, phytoene desaturase (PDS) or chalcone synthase (CHS), by TRV-based VIGS led to a failure of the development of leaf photobleaching or the white-corollas phenotype. PhOBF1 silencing caused down-regulation of RNA silencing-related genes, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs), Dicer-like RNase III enzymes (DCLs), and Argonautes (AGOs). After inoculation with the TRV-PhPDS, PhOBF1-RNAi lines exhibited a substantially impaired PDS silencing efficiency, whereas overexpression of PhOBF1 resulted in a recovery of the silencing phenotype (photobleaching) in systemic leaves. A compromised resistance to TRV and Tobacco mosaic virus was found in PhOBF1-RNAi lines, while PhOBF1-overexpressing lines displayed an enhanced resistance to their infections. Compared with wild-type plants, PhOBF1-silenced plants accumulated lower levels of free salicylic acid (SA), salicylic acid glucoside, and phenylalanine, contrarily to higher levels of those in plants overexpressing PhOBF1. Furthermore, transcripts of a number of genes associated with the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways were decreased or increased in PhOBF1-RNAi or PhOBF1-overexpressing lines, respectively. Taken together, the data suggest that PhOBF1 regulates TRV-induced RNA silencing efficiency through modulation of RDRs, DCLs, and AGOs mediated by the SA biosynthesis pathway.",eng,,,,2017,1,6,ppublish,Acyltransferases|Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors|Oxidoreductases|Petunia|Plant Leaves|Plant Proteins|RNA Interference|RNA Viruses,D000217|D050976|D010088|D032306|D018515|D010940|D034622|D012328,Phenylpropanoid pathways|salicylic acid biosynthesis|shikimate|tobacco mosaic virus|tobacco rattle virus|transcription factor|virus-induced gene silencing.

BaMV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. This gene product, designated as NbTRXh2, was matched with sequences of thioredoxin h proteins, a group of small proteins with a conserved active-site motif WCXPC conferring disulfide reductase activity. To examine how NbTRXh2 is involved in the infection cycle of BaMV, we used the virus-induced gene silencing technique to knock down NbTRXh2 expression in N. benthamiana and inoculated the plants with BaMV. We observed that, compared with control plants, BaMV coat protein accumulation increased in knockdown plants at 5 days post-inoculation (dpi). Furthermore, BaMV coat protein accumulation did not differ significantly between NbTRXh2-knockdown and control protoplasts at 24 hpi. The BaMV infection foci in NbTRXh2-knockdown plants were larger than those in control plants. In addition, BaMV coat protein accumulation decreased when NbTRXh2 was transiently expressed in plants. These results suggest that NbTRXh2 plays a role in restricting BaMV accumulation. Moreover, confocal microscopy results showed that NbTRXh2-OFP (NbTRXh2 fused with orange fluorescent protein) localized at the plasma membrane, similar to AtTRXh9, a homologue in Arabidopsis. The expression of the mutant that did not target the substrates failed to reduce BaMV accumulation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the viral movement protein TGBp2 could be the target of NbTRXh2. Overall, the functional role of NbTRXh2 in reducing the disulfide bonds of targeting factors, encoded either by the host or virus (TGBp2), is crucial in restricting BaMV movement.",eng,2017,03,12,2017,1,5,ppublish,Gene Silencing|Plant Proteins|Potexvirus|Thioredoxins|Tobacco,D020868|D010940|D017863|D013879|D014026,Bamboo mosaic virus|thioredoxin|virus movement|virus-induced gene silencing

Deformation of biomolecules comes from three sources: sample instability, adsorption to the imaging substrate, and crushing under tip pressure. To disentangle these causes, we measured the maximum height of a well-known biomolecule, the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), under eight different experimental conditions positing that the maximum height value is a specific indicator of sample deformations. Six basic AFM experimental factors were tested: imaging in air (AIR) versus in liquid (LIQ), imaging with flat minerals (MICA) versus flat organic surfaces (self-assembled monolayers, SAM), and imaging forces with oscillating tapping mode (TAP) versus PeakForce tapping (PFT). The results show that the most critical parameter in accurately measuring the height of TMV in air is the substrate. In a liquid environment, regardless of the substrate, the most critical parameter is the imaging mode. Most importantly, the expected TMV height values were obtained with both imaging with the PeakForce tapping mode either in liquid or in air at the condition of using self-assembled monolayers as substrate. This study unambiguously explains previous poor results of imaging biomolecules on mica in air and suggests alternative methodologies for depositing soft biomolecules on well organized self-assembled monolayers.",eng,2016,12,23,2016,12,27,ppublish,"Microscopy, Atomic Force|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D018625|D014027,AFM topography|Mica|Peakforce tapping|Self-assembled monolayers|Single molecule deformation|Tobacco mosaic virus

To create a tool to screen for resistance genes, we cloned a wild ZYMV isolate and inserted the visual marker Rosea1 to obtain recombinant clone ZYMV-Ros1.

However, the recombinant virus did induce dark red pigmentation in infected tissues of the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. In this species, ZYMV-Ros1 multiplied efficiently in local inoculated tissue but only a few progeny particles established infection foci in upper leaves. We used this system to analyze the roles of Dicer-like (DCL) genes, core components of plant antiviral RNA silencing pathways, in ZYMV infection. ZYMV-Ros1 local replication was not significantly affected in single DCL knockdown lines nor in double DCL2/4 and triple DCL2/3/4 knockdown lines.

At two upstream (5') sites tested, simple hybridization was not sufficient for stable stalling, which correlates with previous findings on a non-symmetric assembly of TMV. The growth of DNA-arrested particles could be restarted efficiently by displacement of the stopper via its toehold by using a release DNA oligomer, even after storage for twelve days. This novel strategy for growing proteinaceous tubes under tight kinetic and spatial control combines RNA guidance and its site-specific but reversible interruption by DNA blocking elements. As three of the RNA scaffolds contained long heterologous non-TMV sequence portions that included the stopping sites, this method is applicable to all RNAs amenable to TMV CP encapsidation, albeit with variable efficiency most likely depending on the scaffolds' secondary structures. The use of two distinct, selectively addressable CP variants during the serial assembly stages finally enabled an externally configured fabrication of nanotubes with highly defined subdomains.

860,27578623,Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,The IRE1/bZIP60 Pathway and Bax Inhibitor 1 Suppress Systemic Accumulation of Potyviruses and Potexviruses in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana Plants.,,"The inositol requiring enzyme (IRE1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor. When activated, it splices the bZIP60 mRNA, producing a truncated transcription factor that upregulates genes involved in the unfolded protein response. Bax inhibitor 1 (BI-1) is another ER stress sensor that regulates cell death in response to environmental assaults. The potyvirus 6K2 and potexvirus TGB3 proteins are known to reside in the ER, serving, respectively, as anchors for the viral replicase and movement protein complex. This study used green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV), Potato virus Y (PVY), and Potato virus X (PVX) to determine that the IRE1/bZIP60 pathway and BI-1 machinery are induced early in virus infection in Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana benthamiana, and Solanum tuberosum. Agrodelivery of only the potyvirus 6K2 or TGB3 genes into plant cells activated bZIP60 and BI-1 expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, N. benthamiana, and S. tuberosum. Homozygous ire1a-2, ire1b-4, and ire1a-2/ire1b-4 mutant Arabidopsis plants were inoculated with TuMV-GFP or PlAMV-GFP. PlAMV accumulates to a higher level in ire1a-2 or ire1a-2/ire1b-4 mutant plants than in ire1b-4 or wild-type plants. TuMV-GFP accumulates to a higher level in ire1a-2, ire1b-4, or ire1a-2/ire1b-4 compared with wild-type plants, suggesting that both isoforms contribute to TuMV-GFP infection. Gene silencing was used to knock down bZIP60 and BI-1 expression in N. benthamiana. PVX-GFP and PVY-GFP accumulation was significantly elevated in these silenced plants compared with control plants. This study demonstrates that two ER stress pathways, namely IRE1/bZIP60 and the BI-1 pathway, limit systemic accumulation of potyvirus and potexvirus infection. Silencing BI-1 expression also resulted in systemic necrosis. These data suggest that ER stress-activated pathways, led by IRE1 and BI-1, respond to invading potyvirus and potexviruses to restrict virus infection and enable physiological changes enabling plants to tolerate virus assault.",eng,2016,10,24,2016,11,5,ppublish,"Amino Acid Sequence|Arabidopsis|Arabidopsis Proteins|Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors|Genes, Reporter|Membrane Proteins|Phylogeny|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Potexvirus|Potyvirus|RNA Splicing|RNA, Messenger|Sequence Alignment|Tobacco|Transcriptional Activation",D000595|D017360|D029681|D050976|D017930|D008565|D010802|D010935|D018515|D017863|D017800|D012326|D012333|D016415|D014026|D015533,

To counteract this host immune response, viruses have evolved an effective strategy to protect themselves by the expression of viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs). Most potyviruses encode two VSRs, helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) and viral genome-linked protein (VPg). The molecular biology of the former has been well characterized, whereas how VPg exerts its function in the suppression of RNA silencing is yet to be understood. In this study, we show that infection by Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) causes reduced levels of suppressor of gene silencing 3 (SGS3), a key component of the RNA silencing pathway that functions in double-stranded RNA synthesis for virus-derived small interfering RNA (vsiRNA) production. We also demonstrate that among 11 TuMV-encoded viral proteins, VPg is the only one that interacts with SGS3. We furthermore present evidence that the expression of VPg alone, independent of viral infection, is sufficient to induce the degradation of SGS3 and its intimate partner RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6). Moreover, we discover that the VPg-mediated degradation of SGS3 occurs via both the 20S ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy pathways.

It has attributes that make it an ideal choice to produce mass casualties and is a prime candidate for use as a biological weapon. When aerosolized, Y. pestis causes pneumonic plague, a pneumonia that is 100% lethal if not promptly treated with effective antibiotics. Currently, there is no FDA approved plague vaccine. The current lead vaccine candidate, a parenterally administered protein subunit vaccine comprised of the Y. pestis virulence factors, F1 and LcrV, demonstrated variable levels of protection in primate pneumonic plague models. As the most likely mode of exposure in biological attack with Y. pestis is by aerosol, this raises a question of whether this parenteral vaccine will adequately protect humans against pneumonic plague. In the present study we evaluated two distinct mucosal delivery platforms for the intranasal (IN) administration of LcrV and F1 vaccine proteins, a live bacterial vector, Lactobacillus plantarum, and a Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) based delivery platform. IN administration of L. plantarum expressing LcrV, or TMV-conjugated to LcrV and F1 (TMV-LcrV+TMV-F1) resulted in the similar induction of high titers of IgG antibodies and evidence of proinflammatory cytokine secretion. However, only the TMV-conjugate delivery platform protected against subsequent lethal challenge with Y. pestis. TMV-LcrV+TMV-F1 co-vaccinated mice had no discernable morbidity and no mortality, while mice vaccinated with L. plantarum expressing LcrV or rLcrV+rF1 without TMV succumbed to infection or were only partially protected.

Finally, low-cost food-grade enzymes were used for the protoplast isolation procedure, circumventing the need for lab-grade enzymes that are cost-prohibitive in high-throughput automated protoplast isolation and analysis. Based on the protocol developed in this work, the complete procedure from protoplast isolation to transformation can be conducted in under 4 hr, without any input from the operator.

871,27759140,Soft matter,Using tobacco mosaic virus to probe enhanced surface diffusion of molecular glasses.,,"Recent studies have shown that diffusion on the surface of organic glasses can be many orders of magnitude faster than bulk diffusion. Developing new probes that can readily measure surface diffusion can help study the effect of parameters such as chemical structure, intermolecular interaction, molecules' shape and size on the enhanced surface diffusion. In this study, we develop a novel probe that significantly simplifies these types of studies. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is used as probe particle to measure surface diffusion coefficient of molecular glass N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine (TPD). The evolution of the meniscus formed around TMV is probed as a function of time at various temperatures. TMV has a well-defined, mono-dispersed, cylindrical shape, with a large aspect-ratio (average diameter of 16.6 nm, length of 300 nm). As such, the shape of the meniscus around the center of TMV is semi-two dimensional, which compared to using a nanosphere as probe, increases the driving force for meniscus formation and simplifies the analysis of surface diffusion. We show that under these conditions, after a short transient time the shape of the meniscus is self-similar, allowing accurate determination of the surface diffusion coefficient. Measurements at various temperatures are then performed to investigate the temperature dependence of the surface diffusion coefficient. It is found that surface diffusion is greatly enhanced in TPD and has a lower activation barrier compared to the bulk counterpart. These observations are consistent with previous studies of surface diffusion on molecular glasses, demonstrating the accuracy of this method.",eng,,,,2016,10,21,ppublish,Diffusion|Glass|Temperature|Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D004058|D005898|D013696|D014027,

Here we report findings showing that viral infection influences stomatal development in two susceptible host systems (Nicotiana tabacum with TMV (Tobacco mosaic virus), and Arabidopsis thaliana with TVCV (Turnip vein-clearing virus)), but not in resistant host systems (Nicotiana glutinosa and Chenopodium quinoa with TMV). Virus infected plants had significantly lower stomatal indices in systemic leaves of susceptible systems; N. tabacum 9.8% reduction and A. thaliana 12.3% reduction, but not in the resistant hosts. Stomatal density in systemic leaves was also significantly reduced in virus infected A. thaliana by 19.6% but not in N. tabacum or the resistant systems. In addition, transpiration rate was significantly reduced in TMV infected N. tabacum.",eng,2016,09,30,2016,10,1,epublish,,,

We report the association of a cell wall localized ascorbate oxidase (CsAO4) from Cucumis sativus with the movement protein (MP) of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). This was identified first in a yeast two-hybrid screen and validated by in vivo pull down and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. The BiFC assay showed localization of the bimolecular complexes of these proteins around the cell wall periphery as punctate spots. The expression of CsAO4 was induced during the initial infection period (up to 72 h) in CMV infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants. To functionally validate its role in viral spread, we analyzed the virus accumulation in CsAO4 overexpressing Arabidopsis thaliana and transiently silenced N. benthamiana plants (through a Tobacco rattle virus vector). Overexpression had no evident effect on virus accumulation in upper non-inoculated leaves of transgenic lines in comparison to WT plants at 7 days post inoculation (dpi). However, knockdown resulted in reduced CMV accumulation in systemic (non-inoculated) leaves of NbÎAO-pTRV2 silenced plants as compared to TRV inoculated control plants at 5 dpi (up to 1.3 fold difference). In addition, functional validation supported the importance of AO in plant development. These findings suggest that AO and viral MP interaction helps in early viral movement; however, it had no major effect on viral accumulation after 7 dpi. This study suggests that initial induction of expression of AO on virus infection and its association with viral MP helps both towards targeting of the MP to the apoplast and disrupting formation of functional AO dimers for spread of virus to nearby cells, reducing the redox defense of the plant during initial stages of infection.",eng,2016,09,26,2016,9,27,epublish,,,

Holmes that necrotic local lesions induced on certain species of Nicotiana following rub-inoculation of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was due to a specific interaction involving a dominant host gene (N). From this, Holmes had an idea that if the N gene from N. glutinosa was introgressed into susceptible tobacco, the greatly reduced titer of TMV would, by extension, prevent subsequent infection of tomato and pepper plants by field workers whose hands were contaminated with TMV from their use of chewing and smoking tobacco. The ultimate outcome has many surprising twists and turns, including Holmes' failure to obtain fertile crosses of N. glutinosa Ã N. tabacum after 3 years of intensive work. Progress was made with N. digluta, a rare amphidiploid that was readily crossed with N. tabacum. And, importantly, the first demonstration by Holmes of the utility of interspecies hybridization for virus resistance was made with Capsicum (pepper) species with the identification of the L gene in Tabasco pepper, that he introgressed into commercial bell pepper varieties.

These mechanisms are known as the RNA Quality Control or RQC pathways. In plants, another important RNA degradation mechanism is the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mediated by small RNAs (siRNAs). Notably, the RQC pathway antagonizes PTGS by preventing the entry of dysfunctional mRNAs into the silencing pathway to avoid global degradation of mRNA by siRNAs. Viral transcripts must evade RNA degrading mechanisms, thus viruses encode PTGS suppressor proteins to counteract viral RNA silencing. Here, we demonstrate that tobacco plants infected with TMV and transgenic lines expressing TMV MP and CP (coat protein) proteins (which are not linked to the suppression of silencing) display increased transcriptional levels of RNA decay genes. These plants also showed accumulation of cytoplasmic RNA granules with altered structure, increased rates of RNA decay for transgenes and defective transgene PTGS amplification. Furthermore, knockdown of RRP41 or RRP43 RNA exosome components led to lower levels of TMV accumulation with milder symptoms after infection, several developmental defects and miRNA deregulation. Thus, we propose that TMV proteins induce RNA decay pathways (in particular exosome components) to impair antiviral PTGS and this defensive mechanism would constitute an additional counter-defense strategy that lead to disease symptoms.",eng,2016,11,24,2016,9,7,ppublish,"Exosome Multienzyme Ribonuclease Complex|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Gene Expression Regulation, Viral|Gene Silencing|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plants, Genetically Modified|RNA Interference|RNA Stability|RNA, Plant|Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction|Signal Transduction|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D063326|D018506|D015967|D020868|D010935|D018515|D030821|D034622|D020871|D018749|D020133|D015398|D014026|D014027,"

More interestingly, the virus particle underneath the MOF shell can be chemically modified using a standard bioconjugation reaction, showing mass transportation within the MOF shell.",eng,2016,08,03,2016,8,4,ppublish,"Metal-Organic Frameworks|Models, Molecular|Nanoparticles|Nanotechnology|Particle Size|Porosity|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Virion",D000073396|D008958|D053758|D036103|D010316|D016062|D014027|D014771,bioconjugation reactions|metal-organic frameworks|nanoparticles|tobacco mosaic virus

Exogenously applied dsRNA exhibits a rapid systemic trafficking in planta , and it is processed successfully by DICER-like proteins producing small interfering RNAs. RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence-specific, post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism, induced by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which protects eukaryotic cells against invasive nucleic acids like viruses and transposons. In the present study, we used a non-transgenic strategy to induce RNAi in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi plants against TMV. DsRNA molecules for the p126 (TMV silencing suppressor) and coat protein (CP) genes were produced by a two-step PCR approach followed by in vitro transcription. The application of TMV p126 dsRNA onto tobacco plants induced greater resistance against TMV infection as compared to CP dsRNA (65 vs. 50Â %). This study also reported the fast systemic spread of TMV p126 dsRNA from the treated (local) to non-treated (systemic) leaves beginning from 1Â h post-application, confirmed by both conventional and real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, we employed a stem-loop RT-PCR and confirmed the presence of a putative viral siRNA for up to 9Â days in local leaves and up to 6Â days in systemic leaves post-application. The approach employed could represent a simple and environmentally safe way for the control of plant viruses in future agriculture.",eng,2016,07,25,2016,7,28,ppublish,"Capsid Proteins|Disease Resistance|Gene Expression Regulation, Viral|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|RNA Interference|RNA Transport|RNA, Double-Stranded|Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction|Time Factors|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Viral Proteins",D036022|D060467|D015967|D054884|D010935|D018515|D034622|D034443|D012330|D020133|D013997|D014026|D014027|D014764,Coat protein|Double-stranded RNA|RNA interference|Silencing suppressor|Systemic transport|Tobacco mosaic virus|p126|siRNAs

However, while virus-induced transcriptional gene silencing (VITGS) via DNA methylation of gene promoter was achieved using several plant RNA viral vectors, it has not yet been done using a satellite DNA viral vector. In this study, a viral satellite DNA associated with tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV), which has been modified as a VIGS vector in previous research, was developed as a VITGS vector. Firstly, the viral satellite DNA VIGS vector was further optimized to a more convenient p1.7A+2mÎ² vector with high silencing efficiency of the phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Secondly, the constructed VITGS vector (TYLCCNV:35S), which carried a portion of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, could successfully induce heritable transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene in the 35S-GFP transgenic N. benthamiana line 16c plants. Moreover, bisulfite sequencing results revealed higher methylated cytosine residues at CG, CHG and CHH sites of the 35S promoter sequence in TYLCCNV:35S-inoculated plants than in TYLCCNV-inoculated line 16c plants (control).

X-ray scattering is a label-free bulk method that can probe the structure of large self-assembled complexes in solution. As we demonstrate in this paper, solution X-ray scattering can measure complex supramolecular assemblies at high sensitivity and resolution. At high resolution, however, data analysis of larger complexes is computationally demanding. We present an efficient method to compute the scattering curves from complex structures over a wide range of scattering angles. In our computational method, structures are defined as hierarchical trees in which repeating subunits are docked into their assembly symmetries, describing the manner subunits repeat in the structure (in other words, the locations and orientations of the repeating subunits). The amplitude of the assembly is calculated by computing the amplitudes of the basic subunits on 3D reciprocal-space grids, moving up in the hierarchy, calculating the grids of larger structures, and repeating this process for all the leaves and nodes of the tree. For very large structures, we developed a hybrid method that sums grids of smaller subunits in order to avoid numerical artifacts. We developed protocols for obtaining high-resolution solution X-ray scattering data from taxol-free microtubules at a wide range of scattering angles. We then validated our method by adequately modeling these high-resolution data. The higher speed and accuracy of our method, over existing methods, is demonstrated for smaller structures: short microtubule and tobacco mosaic virus. Our algorithm may be integrated into various structure prediction computational tools, simulations, and theoretical models, and provide means for testing their predicted structural model, by calculating the expected X-ray scattering curve and comparing with experimental data.",eng,2016,07,29,2016,7,14,ppublish,"Algorithms|Microtubules|Models, Molecular|Molecular Conformation|Solutions|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|X-Ray Diffraction",D000465|D008870|D008958|D008968|D012996|D014027|D014961,

The study presented here has investigated the biology of two deltasatellites found in wild malvaceous plants in the New World (NW). Infectious clones of two NW deltasatellites (from Malvastrum coromandelianum and Sidastrum micranthum) and associated begomoviruses were constructed. Infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana and their natural malvaceous hosts was assessed. The NW deltasatellites were not able to spread autonomously in planta, whereas they were maintained by the associated bipartite begomovirus. Furthermore, NW deltasatellites were transreplicated by a monopartite NW begomovirus, tomato leaf deformation virus. However, they were not maintained by begomoviruses from the Old World (tomato yellow leaf curl virus, tomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus and African cassava mosaic virus) or a curtovirus (beet curly top virus). NW deltasatellites did not affect the symptoms induced by the helper viruses but in some cases reduced their accumulation. Moreover, one NW deltasatellite was shown to be transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, the vector of its helper begomoviruses. These results confirm that these molecules are true satellites.

Two gene expression cassettes were designed to express the recombinant protein in either the ER or to the apoplastic compartment. Leaf homogenization was used to isolate ER-retained recombinant butyrylcholinesterase (prBChE-ER) while apoplast-targeted rBChE was isolated by either leaf homogenization (prBChE) or vacuum-extraction of apoplastic wash fluid (prBChE-AWF). rBChE from apoplast wash fluid had a higher specific activity but lower enzyme yield than leaf homogenate. To optimize the isolation and purification of total recombinant protein from leaf homogenates, an acidic extraction buffer was used. The acidic extraction buffer yielded >95% enzymatically active tetrameric rBChE as verified by Coomassie stained and native gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, when compared to human butyrylcholinesterase, the prBChE was found to be similar in terms of tetramerization and enzyme kinetics. The N-linked glycan profile of purified prBChE-ER was found to be mostly high mannose structures while the N-linked glycans on prBChE-AWF were primarily complex. The glycan profile of the prBChE leaf homogenates showed a mixture of high mannose, complex and paucimannose type N-glycans. These findings demonstrate the ability of plants to produce rBChE that is enzymatically active and whose oligomeric state is comparable to mammalian butyrylcholinesterase. The process of plant made rBChE tetramerization and strategies for improving its pharmacokinetics properties are also discussed.

ROS have multifaceted signaling functions in mediating the establishment of multiple responses. To verify whether hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) contributes to plant virus infection and the development of induced symptoms, we used fluorescence to monitor the generation of H2 O2 and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to investigate the subcellular distribution of H2 O2 in leaves. In this study, the M strain of Cucumber mosaic virus (M-CMV) induced heavy chlorotic symptoms in Nicotiana tabacum cv. white burley during systemic infection. Compared with mock-inoculated leaves, H2 O2 accumulation in inoculated leaves increased after inoculation, then decreased after 4Â days. For systemically infected leaves that showed chlorotic symptoms, H2 O2 accumulation was always higher than in healthy leaves. Subcellular H2 O2 localization observed using CLSM showed that H2 O2 in inoculated leaves was generated mainly in the chloroplasts and cell wall, whereas in systemically infected leaves H2 O2 was generated mainly in the cytosol. The levels of coat protein in inoculated and systemically infected leaves might be associated with changes in the level of H2 O2 and symptom development. Further research is needed to elucidate the generation mechanism and the relationship between coat protein and oxidative stress during infection and symptom development.

Thereby, the CTF is first estimated and subsequently the electron micrograph is corrected, so that the negative oscillations of the CTF are equalized. Typically, the CTF correction is performed in 2D and the tilt-induced focus gradient is taken into account. Most often, the sample-thickness-induced focus gradient is ignored. Theoretical considerations, as well as implementation suggestions, for a 3D CTF correction that considers both gradients have been proposed before, although an implementation achieving a resolution improvement has been lacking, primarily due to computational reasons. Here, we present a comprehensive solution for a 3D CTF correction based on the Jensen-Kornberg scheme, which performs a slice-by-slice correction of the CTF within the tomographic reconstruction. We show that the computational requirements are comparable to those of 2D CTF correction. Using the examples of mitochondrial ribosomes and tobacco mosaic virus we demonstrate the improvement of the reconstruction quality with the 3D CTF correction, and the resolution gain on sub-tomogram averaging.

Some viruses severely modify the PD structure, as they assemble a virion carrying tubule composed of the viral movement protein (MP) inside the PD channel. Successful modulation of the host plant to allow infection requires an intimate interaction between viral proteins and both structural and regulatory host proteins. To date, however, very few host proteins are known to promote virus spread. Plasmodesmata-located proteins (PDLPs) localised in the PD have been shown to contribute to tubule formation in cauliflower mosaic virus and grapevine fanleaf virus infections. In this study, we have investigated the role of PDLPs in intercellular transport of another tubule-forming virus, cowpea mosaic virus. The MP of this virus was found to interact with PDLPs in the PD, as was shown for other tubule-forming viruses. Expression of PDLPs and MPs in protoplasts in the absence of a PD revealed that these proteins do not co-localise at the site of tubule initiation. Furthermore, we show that tubule assembly in protoplasts does not require an interaction with PDLPs at the base of the tubule, as has been observed in planta. These results suggest that a physical interaction between MPs and PDLPs is not required for assembly of the movement tubule and that the beneficial role of PDLPs in virus movement is confined to the structural context of the PD.

During the late 19th century, their behavior in filtration tests applied to the agent causing the 'plant mosaic disease' eventually led to the discrimination of viruses from bacteria. Thereafter, they promoted the development of biophysical cornerstone techniques such as electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation. Since the 1950s, the robust, helically arranged nucleoprotein complexes consisting of a single RNA and more than 2100 identical coat protein subunits have enabled molecular studies which have pioneered the understanding of viral replication and self-assembly, and elucidated major aspects of virus-host interplay, which can lead to agronomically relevant diseases. However, during the last decades, TMV has acquired a new reputation as a well-defined high-yield nanotemplate with multivalent protein surfaces, allowing for an ordered high-density presentation of multiple active molecules or synthetic compounds. Amino acid side chains exposed on the viral coat may be tailored genetically or biochemically to meet the demands for selective conjugation reactions, or to directly engineer novel functionality on TMV-derived nanosticks. The natural TMV size (length: 300 nm) in combination with functional ligands such as peptides, enzymes, dyes, drugs or inorganic materials is advantageous for applications ranging from biomedical imaging and therapy approaches over surface enlargement of battery electrodes to the immobilization of enzymes. TMV building blocks are also amenable to external control of in vitro assembly and re-organization into technically expedient new shapes or arrays, which bears a unique potential for the development of 'smart' functional 3D structures. Among those, materials designed for enzyme-based biodetection layouts, which are routinely applied, e.g., for monitoring blood sugar concentrations, might profit particularly from the presence of TMV rods: Their surfaces were recently shown to stabilize enzymatic activities upon repeated consecutive uses and over several weeks. This review gives the reader a ride through strikingly diverse achievements obtained with TMV-based particles, compares them to the progress with related viruses, and focuses on latest results revealing special advantages for enzyme-based biosensing formats, which might be of high interest for diagnostics employing 'systems-on-a-chip'.

These methods combine linear-scaling (LS) Kohn-Sham (KS) density functional theory (DFT) with subsystem (SS) DFT. LS DFT is efficient for large subsystems, while SS DFT is linear scaling with a smaller prefactor for large sets of small molecules. The combination of SS and LS, which is an embedding approach, can result in a 10-fold speedup over a pure LS simulation for large systems in aqueous solution. In addition to a ground-state Born-Oppenheimer SS+LS implementation, a time-dependent density functional theory-based Ehrenfest molecular dynamics (EMD) using density matrix propagation is presented that allows for performing nonadiabatic dynamics. Density matrix-based EMD in the SS framework is naturally linear scaling and appears suitable to study the electronic dynamics of molecules in solution. In the LS framework, linear scaling results as long as the density matrix remains sparse during time propagation. However, we generally find a less than exponential decay of the density matrix after a sufficiently long EMD run, preventing LS EMD simulations with arbitrary accuracy. The methods are tested on various systems, including spectroscopy on dyes, the electronic structure of TiO2 nanoparticles, electronic transport in carbon nanotubes, and the satellite tobacco mosaic virus in explicit solution.

In addition to intracellular localization, plants support the trafficking of RNA molecules also between cells through plasmodesmata (PD), which has important roles in the cell-to-cell and systemic communication during plant growth and development. Viruses have developed strategies to exploit the underlying plant RNA transport mechanisms for the cell-to-cell and systemic dissemination of infection. In vivo RNA visualization methods have revolutionized the study of RNA dynamics in living cells. However, their application in plants is still in its infancy. To gain insights into the RNA transport mechanisms in plants, we study the localization and transport of Tobacco mosaic virus RNA using MS2 tagging. This technique involves the tagging of the RNA of interest with repeats of an RNA stem-loop (SL) that is derived from the origin of assembly of the bacteriophage MS2 and recruits the MS2 coat protein (MCP). Thus, expression of MCP fused to a fluorescent marker allows the specific visualization of the SL-carrying RNA.

The TaMCA1 protein contained typical structural features of type I metacaspases domains, including an N-terminal pro-domain.

TaMCA1 exhibited no caspase-1 activity in vitro, but was able to inhibit cell death in tobacco and wheat leaves induced by the mouse Bax gene. In addition, the expression level of TaMCA1 was up-regulated following challenge with the Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Knockdown of TaMCA1 via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) enhanced plant disease resistance to Pst, and the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Further study showed that TaMCA1 decreased yeast cell resistance similar to the function of yeast metacaspase, and there was no interaction between TaMCA1 and TaLSD1.

In addition to the primary role of the capsid protein (CP) in encapsidating the RNA progeny, experimental evidence on positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses suggests that the CP also regulates RNA synthesis.

We identified that the STMV CP-HV replicase interaction requires a positively charged residue at the third position (3R) in the N-terminal 13 amino acid (aa) motif. Far-Northwestern blotting showed that STMV CP promotes binding between HV-replicase and STMV RNA. An STMV CP variant having an arginine to alanine substitution at position 3 in the N-terminal 13aa motif abolished replicase-CP binding. The N-terminal 13aa motif of the CP bearing alanine substitutions for positively charged residues located at positions 5, 7, 10 and 11 are defective in packaging full-length STMV, but can package a truncated STMV RNA lacking the 3' terminal 150ânt region.

Its expression is induced during the early stages of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) infection by the potyvirus Pepper yellow mosaic virus (PepYMV, a close relative of Potato virus Y). Tomato TCTP is a protein of 168 amino acids, which contains all the conserved domains of the TCTP family. To study the effects of TCTP silencing in PepYMV infection, Nicotiana benthamiana plants were silenced by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) and transgenic tomato plants silenced for TCTP were obtained. In the early stages of infection, both tomato and N. benthamiana silenced plants accumulated less virus than control plants. Transgenic tomato plants showed a drastic reduction in symptoms and no viral accumulation at 14 days post-inoculation. Subcellular localization of TCTP was determined in healthy and systemically infected N. benthamiana leaves. TCTP was observed in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of non-infected cells, but only in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Our results indicate that TCTP is a growth regulator necessary for successful PepYMV infection and that its localization is altered by the virus, probably to favour the establishment of virus infection.

In the present study, we examined autophagy induced by potato virus Y ordinary strain (PVY(O)) infection in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that the number of virus particles in the plant peaked at 2 weeks post-inoculation and then gradually decreased. Additionally, the amount of virus increased significantly in the 3rd and 4th leaves distal to the inoculated leaf and decreased slightly in the 5th leaf. Within 2 weeks of PVY(O) inoculation, the tobacco leaves showed typical symptoms of Potyvirus inoculation, including mottling, yellowing, a mosaic pattern, and necrotic tissue changes at the inoculated site. Based on an ultrastructural analysis of the PVY(O)-infected tobacco leaves, virus aggregates appeared as longitudinal and transverse arrays and pinwheels, which are typical of Potyvirus inoculation. Moreover, PVY(O) infection caused changes in the number, size, and shape of chloroplasts, whereas the number of plastogranules increased markedly. Furthermore, double-membrane autophagosome-like vacuoles, including electron-dense materials, laminated structures, and cellular organelles, were found. The induction of autophagy after the PVY(O) infection of tobacco leaves was further confirmed by the expression of lipidated microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II, an autophagy marker and p62, an autophagy adaptor protein. The LC3-II levels increased daily over the 4-week period. Although virus inoculation was performed systemically on the basal leaves of the plants, LC3-II was expressed throughout the leaves and the expression was higher in leaves distal to the inoculated leaf. Moreover, PVY(O) infection caused the activation of stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinases.

An aquaporin gene expressed in intraradical mycelia was characterized and knocked down by virus-induced gene silencing to investigate the involvement of the gene in polyphosphate translocation. Rhizophagus clarus aquaporin 3 (RcAQP3) that was most highly expressed in intraradical mycelia encodes an aquaglyceroporin responsible for water transport across the plasma membrane. Knockdown of RcAQP3 as well as the suppression of host transpiration decelerated polyphosphate translocation in proportion to the levels of knockdown and suppression, respectively. These results provide the first insight into the mechanism underlying long-distance polyphosphate translocation in mycorrhizal associations at the molecular level, in which host transpiration and the fungal aquaporin play key roles. A hypothetical model of the translocation is proposed for further elucidation of the mechanism.",eng,2016,05,03,2016,5,4,ppublish,"Aquaporins|Biological Transport|Gene Knockdown Techniques|Gene Silencing|Genes, Fungal|Glomeromycota|Lotus|Models, Biological|Mycelium|Mycorrhizae|Phylogeny|Plant Transpiration|Plant Viruses|Polyphosphates|Symbiosis|Tobacco",D020346|D001692|D055785|D020868|D005800|D055137|D000070116|D008954|D025282|D038821|D010802|D018526|D010942|D011122|D013559|D014026,Rhizophagus clarus|aquaglyceroporin|aquaporin|arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM)|cucumber mosaic virus|polyphosphate translocation|transpiration|virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)
929,27136578,Viruses,Characterization of a Novel Polerovirus Infecting Maize in China.,10.3390/v8050120,"A novel virus, tentatively named Maize Yellow Mosaic Virus (MaYMV), was identified from the field-grown maize plants showing yellow mosaic symptoms on the leaves collected from the Yunnan Province of China by the deep sequencing of small RNAs. The complete 5642 nucleotide (nt)-long genome of the MaYMV shared the highest nucleotide sequence identity (73%) to Maize Yellow Dwarf Virus-RMV. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses suggested that MaYMV represents a new member of the genus Polerovirus in the family Luteoviridae. Furthermore, the P0 protein encoded by MaYMV was demonstrated to inhibit both local and systemic RNA silencing by co-infiltration assays using transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana line 16c carrying the GFP reporter gene, which further supported the identification of a new polerovirus. The biologically-active cDNA clone of MaYMV was generated by inserting the full-length cDNA of MaYMV into the binary vector pCB301. RT-PCR and Northern blot analyses showed that this clone was systemically infectious upon agro-inoculation into N. benthamiana. Subsequently, 13 different isolates of MaYMV from field-grown maize plants in different geographical locations of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces of China were sequenced. Analyses of their molecular variation indicate that the 3' half of P3-P5 read-through protein coding region was the most variable, whereas the coat protein- (CP-) and movement protein- (MP-)coding regions were the most conserved.",eng,2016,04,28,2016,5,3,epublish,"China|Cloning, Molecular|Cluster Analysis|Gene Silencing|Genetic Variation|Genome, Viral|High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Luteoviridae|Phylogeny|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Reverse Genetics|Sequence Analysis, DNA|Sequence Homology|Tobacco|Zea mays",D002681|D003001|D016000|D020868|D014644|D016679|D059014|D054884|D052679|D010802|D010935|D018515|D059386|D017422|D017385|D014026|D003313,Maize yellow mosaic virus|deep sequencing|infectious clone|molecular variation|sRNA|suppressor

Coarse-grained models then follow by a proper selection of the indexed backbone positions, where for each chain one can choose the desired coarseness. This approach is applied to three viruses, the Satellite tobacco mosaic virus, the bacteriophage MS2 and the Pariacoto virus, on the basis of structural data from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank.

In this study, an interaction between the replication protein of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and phloem-specific auxin/indole acetic acid (Aux/IAA) transcriptional regulators was found to modulate virus phloem loading in an age-dependent manner. Promoter expression studies show that in mature tissues TMV 126/183-kDa-interacting Aux/IAAs predominantly express and accumulate within the nuclei of phloem companion cells (CCs). Furthermore, CC Aux/IAA nuclear localization is disrupted upon infection with an interacting virus. In situ analysis of virus spread shows that the inability to disrupt Aux/IAA CC nuclear localization correlates with a reduced ability to load into the vascular tissue. Subsequent systemic movement assays also demonstrate that a virus capable of disrupting Aux/IAA localization is significantly more competitive at moving out of older plant tissues than a noninteracting virus. Similarly, CC expression and overaccumulation of a degradation-resistant Aux/IAA-interacting protein was found to inhibit TMV accumulation and phloem loading selectively in flowering plants. Transcriptional expression studies demonstrate a role for Aux/IAA-interacting proteins in the regulation of salicylic and jasmonic acid host defense responses as well as virus-specific movement factors, including pectin methylesterase, that are involved in regulating plasmodesmata size-exclusion limits and promoting virus cell-to-cell movement. Combined, these findings indicate that TMV directs the reprogramming of auxin-regulated gene expression within the vascular phloem of mature tissues as a means to enhance phloem loading and systemic spread.",eng,2016,04,26,2016,4,28,ppublish,"Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Indoleacetic Acids|Phloem|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Transcriptional Activation|Viral Load|Virus Internalization",D018506|D007210|D052585|D014026|D014027|D015533|D019562|D053586,age-related resistance|pathogen defense|plant hormone signaling|plasmodesmata gating|virus movement

The aim of this study was to investigate whether viruses that rely on insects for their transmission, and which can be sensitive to the polarization of light, affect the percentage polarization of light reflected from leaves. We also set out to discover whether a correlation exists between the expression of ECERIFERUM (CER) genes involved in cuticular wax synthesis and the polarization of the light reflected from the leaf surfaces. It was found that the aphid-vectored viruses Potato virus Y and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) caused significant reductions in the percentage polarization of light reflected from the abaxial surfaces of leaves of Nicotiana tabacum, whereas the non-insect-vectored viruses Tobacco mosaic virus and Pepino mosaic virus did not induce this effect. In Arabidopsis thaliana, there was little difference in the impacts of CMV and the non-insect-vectored Turnip vein clearing virus on polarization reflection, with both viruses increasing the percentage polarization of light reflected from the abaxial surfaces of leaves. There was a trend towards increased accumulation of CER6 transcripts in N. tabacum and A. thaliana when infected with aphid-vectored viruses. No significant effect of infection on trichome densities was found in A. thaliana, suggesting that alterations to the formation of cuticular waxes may be the more likely phenotypic change on the leaf surface contributing to the changes in polarization reflection. The possible impacts and adaptive significance of these effects with regard to viral transmission by insects are discussed.

However, the transcriptional regulation of these critical components is largely unknown. In petunia (Petunia hybrida), an ethylene-responsive element binding factor, PhERF2, is induced by Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) infection. Inclusion of a PhERF2 fragment in a TRV silencing construct containing reporter fragments of phytoene desaturase (PDS) or chalcone synthase (CHS) substantially impaired silencing efficiency of both the PDS and CHS reporters. Silencing was also impaired in PhERF2- RNAi lines, where TRV-PhPDS infection did not show the expected silencing phenotype (photobleaching). In contrast, photobleaching in response to infiltration with the TRV-PhPDS construct was enhanced in plants overexpressing PhERF2 Transcript abundance of the RNA silencing-related genes RDR2, RDR6, DCL2, and AGO2 was lower in PhERF2-silenced plants but higher in PhERF2-overexpressing plants. Moreover, PhERF2-silenced lines showed higher susceptibility to Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) than wild-type (WT) plants, while plants overexpressing PhERF2 exhibited increased resistance. Interestingly, growth and development of PhERF2-RNAi lines were substantially slower, whereas the overexpressing lines were more vigorous than the controls.

Nanorods with different aspect ratios can be obtained by ultrasound treatment and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. By incubating with epithelial and endothelial cells, we found that the rod-like bionanoparticles with various aspect ratios had different internalization pathways in different cell lines: microtubules transport in HeLa and clathrin-mediated uptake in HUVEC for TMV4 and TMV8; caveolae-mediated pathway and microtubules transport in HeLa and HUVEC for TMV17.

However, viruses have recently been exploited as nanoplatforms with applications in biomedicine and materials science. To this aim, a large majority of current methods and tools have been developed to improve the physical stability of viral particles, which may be critical to the extreme physical or chemical conditions that viruses may encounter during purification, fabrication processes, storage and use. However, considerably fewer studies are devoted to developing efficient methods to degrade or recycle such enhanced stability biomaterials. With this in mind, we carry out all-atom nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation, inspired by the recently developed mid-infrared free-electron laser pulse technology, to dissociate viruses. Adopting the poliovirus as a representative example, we find that the primary step in the dissociation process is due to the strong resonance between the amide I vibrational modes of the virus and the tuned laser frequencies. This process is determined by a balance between the formation and dissociation of the protein shell, reflecting the highly plasticity of the virus. Furthermore, our method should provide a feasible approach to simulate viruses, which is otherwise too expensive for conventional equilibrium all-atom simulations of such very large systems.

A growing body of data indicates advantageous margination and penetration properties of high aspect-ratio nanoparticles, which enhance payload delivery, resulting in increased efficacy. Our lab has demonstrated that elongated rod-shaped and filamentous macromolecular nucleoprotein assemblies from plant viruses have higher tissue diffusion rates than spherical particles. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to quantify diffusion and uptake of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in a spheroid system approximating a capillary-free segment of a solid tumor. Model simulations predict TMV concentration distribution with time in a tumor spheroid for different sizes and cell densities. From simulations of TMV concentration distribution, we can quantify the effect of TMV aspect ratio (e.g., nanorod length-to-width) with and without cellular uptake by modulated surface chemistry.

These films have been electrochemically deposited onto conducting Au surfaces. Upon rebinding, the TNV-polythiophene complex changes the fluorescence intensity of the nanofilm. The fluorescence intensity at 410nm was observed to be proportional to the concentration of viruses in the range of 0.1-10ngL(-1) (0.15-15pg) with the lower calculated detection limit of 2.29ngL(-1) (3.4pg). The intensity of the fluorescence emission is not affected by the thickness of the polythiophene film and the nature of TNV specific binding sites. Kinetic data analyses showed that the nanofilm responds to TNV within 2min; and cross-selectivity studies with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) showed an excellent specificity for the targeted TNV. These binding experiments demonstrate the potential of fluorescence emission for the specific, label free and rapid detection of viruses using nanofilm sensors.

The crop can be affected by a large number of pathogens, including fungi, oomycetes, bacteria and viruses. Diseases caused by viruses are among the most important factors contributing to reduced quality and yield of the crop. Potato mop-top virus (genus Pomovirus) induces necrotic flecks in the tuber flesh and skin of potato in temperate countries. Spongospora subterranea is the vector of PMTV. Both the virus and its vector cause disease in potato. In Colombia, PMTV has been detected throughout the country together with a novel pomo-like virus in the centre (Cundinamarca and BoyacÃ¡) and south west (NariÃ±o) of the country. We studied the molecular and biological characteristics of this novel virus. Its genome resembles those of members of the genus Pomovirus, and it is closely related to PMTV. It induces mild systemic symptoms in Nicotiana benthamiana (mosaic, branch curling), but no symptoms in N. tabacum, N. debneyi and Chenopodium amaranticolor. The proposed name for the virus is ""Colombian potato soil-borne virus"" (CPSbV). Additionally, another pomo-like virus was identified in NariÃ±o. This virus induces severe systemic stem declining and mild mosaic in N. benthamiana. The tentative name ""soil-borne virus 2"" (SbV2) is proposed for this virus.

Plants synthesize a variety of secondary metabolites to protect themselves from the invading microbial pathogens. Several studies have shown that salicylic acid (SA) is a key endogenous component of local and systemic disease resistance in plants. Although SA is a critical signal for SAR, accumulation of endogenous SA levels alone is insufficient to establish SAR. Here, we have identified a new acyl derivative of SA, the benzoylsalicylic acid (BzSA) also known as 2-(benzoyloxy) benzoic acid from the seed coats of Givotia rottleriformis and investigated its role in inducing SAR in tobacco and Arabidopsis. Interestingly, exogenous BzSA treatment induced the expression of NPR1 (Non-expressor of pathogenesis-related gene-1) and pathogenesis related (PR) genes. BzSA enhanced the expression of hypersensitivity related (HSR), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and WRKY genes in tobacco. Moreover, Arabidopsis NahG plants that were treated with BzSA showed enhanced resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as evidenced by reduced leaf necrosis and TMV-coat protein levels in systemic leaves. We, therefore, conclude that BzSA, hitherto unknown natural plant product, is a new SAR inducer in plants.

In vivo tumor delivery and efficacy were confirmed by using a mouse model of triple negative breast cancer.

Members of the I2-like family constitute a well-conserved subgroup of NB-LRRs from Solanaceae possessing a coiled-coil (CC) domain at their N termini. We show here that the CC domains of several I2-like proteins are able to induce a hypersensitive response (HR), a form of programmed cell death associated with disease resistance. Using yeast two-hybrid screens, we identified the chloroplastic protein Thylakoid Formation1 (THF1) as an interacting partner for several I2-like CC domains. Co-immunoprecipitations and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed that THF1 and I2-like CC domains interact in planta and that these interactions take place in the cytosol. Several HR-inducing I2-like CC domains have a negative effect on the accumulation of THF1, suggesting that the latter is destabilized by active CC domains. To confirm this model, we investigated N', which recognizes the coat protein of most Tobamoviruses, as a prototypical member of the I2-like family. Transient expression and gene silencing data indicated that THF1 functions as a negative regulator of cell death and that activation of full-length N' results in the destabilization of THF1. Consistent with the known function of THF1 in maintaining chloroplast homeostasis, we show that the HR induced by N' is light-dependent.

VNPs have many advantageous properties such as ease of manufacture and high degree of quality control. Their biocompatibility and biodegradability make them an attractive alternative to synthetic nanoparticles (NPs). Nevertheless, as with synthetic NPs, to be successful in drug delivery or imaging, the carriers need to overcome several biological barriers including innate immune recognition. Plasma opsonization can tag (V)NPs for clearance by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS), resulting in shortened circulation half lives and non-specific sequestration in non-targeted organs. PEG coatings have been traditionally used to 'shield' nanocarriers from immune surveillance. However, due to broad use of PEG in cosmetics and other industries, the prevalence of anti-PEG antibodies has been reported, which may limit the utility of PEGylation in nanomedicine. Alternative strategies are needed to tailor the inÂ vivo properties of (plant virus-based) nanocarriers. We demonstrate the use of serum albumin (SA) as a viable alternative. SA conjugation to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-based nanocarriers results in a 'camouflage' effect more effective than PEG coatings. SA-'camouflaged' TMV particles exhibit decreased antibody recognition, as well as enhanced pharmacokinetics in a Balb/C mouse model.

Interestingly, the DNA-A component of the SLCMV alone is able to infect Nicotiana benthamiana causing symptoms of upward leaf rolling and stunting. One of the differences between monopartite and bipartite begomoviruses is the requirement of Coat Protein (CP) for infectivity; CP being essential for the former, but dispensable in the latter. This investigation was aimed to determine the importance of CP in the infectivity of the bipartite SLCMV, behaving as a monopartite virus in N. benthamiana. We tested CP-null mutants, single amino acid replacement mutants and double, triple and quadruple combinations of the above in SLCMV DNA-A, for infectivity, symptom development and viral DNA accumulation in N. benthamiana.

The bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV) replicon generates massive amounts of DNA copies, which engage the plant transcription machinery. However, we noticed a disparity between transcript level and protein production, suggesting that mRNAs could be more efficiently utilized. In this study, we systematically evaluated genetic elements from human, viral, and plant sources for their potential to improve the BeYDV system. The tobacco extensin terminator enhanced transcript accumulation and protein production compared to other commonly used terminators, indicating that efficient transcript processing plays an important role in recombinant protein production. Evaluation of human-derived 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) indicated that many provided high levels of protein production, supporting their cross-kingdom function. Among the viral 5' UTRs tested, we found the greatest enhancement with the tobacco mosaic virus omega leader. An analysis of the 5' UTRs from the Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotinana benthamiana photosystem I K genes found that they were highly active when truncated to include only the near upstream region, providing a dramatic enhancement of transgene production that exceeded that of the tobacco mosaic virus omega leader. The tobacco Rb7 matrix attachment region inserted downstream from the gene of interest provided significant enhancement, which was correlated with a reduction in plant cell death. Evaluation of Agrobacterium strains found that EHA105 enhanced protein production and reduced cell death compared to LBA4301 and GV3101. We used these improvements to produce Norwalk virus capsid protein at >20% total soluble protein, corresponding to 1.8 mg/g leaf fresh weight, more than twice the highest level ever reported in a plant system. We also produced the monoclonal antibody rituximab at 1 mg/g leaf fresh weight.

Heat-transformation can be applied to TMV yielding spherical nanoparticles (SNPs) measuring ~50nm in size. While bioconjugate chemistries have been established to modify the TMV rod, such methods have not yet been described for the SNP platform. In this work, we probed the reactivity of SNPs toward bioconjugate reactions targeting lysine, glutamine/aspartic acid, and cysteine residues. We demonstrate functionalization of SNPs using these chemistries yielding efficient payload conjugation. In addition to covalent labeling techniques, we developed encapsulation techniques, where the cargo is loaded into the SNP during heat-transition from rod-to-sphere.

Present study investigates its potential as a biocontrol agent against an economically important virus, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), in Nicotiana tabacum cv. White Burley plants and delineates the physical, biophysical, biochemical and molecular perturbations due to the trilateral interactions of PGPR-host-CMV. Soil inoculation of B-30488 enhanced the plant vigor while significantly decreased the virulence and virus RNA accumulation by ~12 fold (91%) in systemic leaves of CMV infected tobacco plants as compared to the control ones. Histology of these leaves revealed the improved tissue's health and least aging signs in B-30488 inoculated tobacco plants, with or without CMV infection, and showed lesser intercellular spaces between collenchyma cells, reduced amount of xyloglucans and pectins in connecting primary cells, and higher polyphenol accumulation in hypodermis layer extending to collenchyma cells. B-30488 inoculation has favorably maneuvered the essential biophysical (ion leakage and photosynthetic efficiency) and biochemical (sugar, proline, chlorophyll, malondialdehyde, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase) attributes of tobacco plants to positively regulate and release the virus stress. Moreover, activities of defense related enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase) induced due to CMV-infection were ameliorated with inoculation of B-30488, suggesting systemic induced resistance mediated protection against CMV in tobacco. The quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the genes related to normal plant development, stress and pathogenesis also corroborate well with the biochemical data and revealed the regulation (either up or down) of these genes in favor of plant to combat the CMV mediated stress. These improvements led tobacco plant to produce more flowers and seeds with no negative impact on plant health. The present study may advocate the applicability of B-30488 for crop yield improvement in virus infested areas.

Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) can establish a compatible interaction in tobacco and Arabidopsis hosts. We show that the coat protein (CP) of AMV interacts directly with transcription factor (TF) ILR3 of both species. ILR3 is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family member of TFs, previously proposed to participate in diverse metabolic pathways. ILR3 has been shown to regulate NEET in Arabidopsis, a critical protein in plant development, senescence, iron metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. We show that the AMV CP-ILR3 interaction causes a fraction of this TF to relocate from the nucleus to the nucleolus. ROS, pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1) mRNAs, salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) contents are increased in healthy Arabidopsis loss-of-function ILR3 mutant (ilr3.2) plants, which implicates ILR3 in the regulation of plant defence responses. In AMV-infected wild-type (wt) plants, NEET expression is reduced slightly, but is induced significantly in ilr3.2 mutant plants. Furthermore, the accumulation of SA and JA is induced in Arabidopsis wt-infected plants. AMV infection in ilr3.2 plants increases JA by over 10-fold, and SA is reduced significantly, indicating an antagonist crosstalk effect. The accumulation levels of viral RNAs are decreased significantly in ilr3.2 mutants, but the virus can still systemically invade the plant. The AMV CP-ILR3 interaction may down-regulate a host factor, NEET, leading to the activation of plant hormone responses to obtain a hormonal equilibrium state, where infection remains at a level that does not affect plant viability.",eng,2016,05,08,2016,3,2,ppublish,"Alfalfa mosaic virus|Arabidopsis|Arabidopsis Proteins|Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors|Capsid Proteins|Cell Nucleus|Cyclopentanes|Fluorescence|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Models, Biological|Mutation|Oxylipins|Plant Diseases|Protein Binding|Protein Transport|Salicylic Acid|Signal Transduction|Staining and Labeling|Subcellular Fractions|Tobacco|Transcription, Genetic",D017794|D017360|D029681|D051792|D036022|D002467|D003517|D005453|D054884|D008954|D009154|D054883|D010935|D011485|D021381|D020156|D015398|D013194|D013347|D014026|D014158,AMV|ROS|coat protein|nucleolus|plant defense|transcription factors|virus-interactions

However, the mechanisms of the action of these compounds on targets remain unclear. To further study the mechanism of the action of the anti-TMV inhibitors, the TMV coat protein (TMV CP) was expressed and self-assembled into four-layer aggregate disks in vitro, which could be reassembled into infectious virus particles with TMV RNA. The interactions between the anti-TMV compounds and the TMV CP disk were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography, isothermal titration calorimetry and native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis methods. The results revealed that assembly of the four-layer aggregate disk was inhibited by NNM; it changed the four-layer aggregate disk into trimers, and affected the regular assembly of TMV CP and TMV RNA. The four-layer aggregate disk of TMV CP was little inhibited by ATF, DFL and BQX.

Electron microscopy techniques allow for obtaining extraordinary resolution by averaging signals from multiple identical structures. In contrast, atomic force microscopy (AFM) collects data from single entities. Here, it is possible to finely modulate the interaction with the samples, in order to be sensitive to their top surface, avoiding mechanical deformations. However, most biological surfaces are highly curved, such as fibers or tubes, and ultimate details of their surface are in the vicinity of steep height variations. This limits lateral resolution, even when sharp probes are used. We overcome this problem by using multifrequency force microscopy on a textbook example, the Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). We achieved unprecedented resolution in local maps of amplitude and phase shift of the second excited mode, recorded together with sample topography. Our data, which combine multifrequency imaging and Fourier analysis, confirm the structure deduced from averaging techniques (XRD, cryoEM) for surface features of single virus particles, down to the helical pitch of the coat protein subunits, 2.3 nm.

Here, we studied image contrast using ice-embedded tobacco mosaic virus particles as test samples at 20-80 keV electron energy. The particles showed the expected increase in contrast for lower energies, but at the same time the 2.3-nm-resolution measure decayed more rapidly. We found a pronounced signal loss below 60 keV, and therefore we conclude that increased inelastic scattering counteracts increased amplitude contrast. This model also implies that as long as the amplitude contrast does not increase with resolution, beam damage and multiple scattering will always win over increased contrast at the lowest energies. Therefore, we cannot expect that low-energy imaging of conventionally prepared samples would provide better data than state-of-the-art 200-300 keV imaging.

Mass per unit length (MPL) estimates can be used to differentiate amyloid fibril morphologies and provide orthogonal evidence for helical symmetry parameters determined by other methods. In addition, MPL data can provide insight on the arrangement of subunits in a fibril, especially for more complex fibrils assembled with multiple parallel copies of the asymmetric unit or multiple twisted protofilaments. By detecting only scattered electrons, which serve as a relative measure of total scattering, and therefore protein mass, dark field imaging gives an approximation of the total mass of protein present in any given length of fibril.

We report here the discovery of two novel DNA sequences, designated SEGS-1 and SEGS-2 (forsequencesenhancinggeminivirussymptoms), that enhance symptoms and break resistance to CMD.

Exogenous applied BRs enhanced plant resistance to virus infection, while application of Bikinin (inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3), which activated BR signaling, increased virus susceptibility. Silencing of NbBRI1 and NbBSK1 blocked BR-induced TMV resistance, and silencing of NbBES1/BZR1 blocked Bikinin-reduced TMV resistance.

Furthermore, we found MEK2-SIPK cascade activated while BES1/BZR1 inhibited RBOHB-dependent ROS production, defense gene expression and virus resistance induced by BRs. Thus, our results revealed BR signaling had two opposite effects on viral defense response. On the one hand, BRs enhanced virus resistance through MEK2-SIPK cascade and RBOHB-dependent ROS burst.

Although agents for multi-photon fluorescence microscopy of the microvasculature are available, issues related to stability, bioavailability, toxicity, cost or chemical adaptability remain to be solved. In particular, there is a need for highly fluorescent dyes linked to particles that do not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) in brain diseases like tumor or stroke to estimate the functional blood supply. Plant virus particles possess a number of distinct advantages over other particles, the most important being the multi-valency of chemically addressable sites on the particle surface. This multi-valency, together with biological compatibility and inert nature, makes plant viruses ideal carriers for in vivo imaging agents.

Here, we present the translocation of rigid rod-shaped tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) through solid-state nanopores. Interestingly, due to the high rigidity of TMV, three types of events with distinctive characteristics at the capture process and a strong current fluctuation during the translocation of TMV are observed. A kinetic model is then proposed to address the dynamics of the translocation, followed by corresponding dynamics simulations. The results reveal that TMV has to rotate to fit and pass the pore when it is captured by a nanopore with an angle larger than the maximum angle that allows it to pass through. Then, we investigate the dependence of the rotation of TMV on the conductance fluctuations at the blockade stage. The results show that the rotation of TMV during the passage through the pore affects the current signal significantly. This study gives a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of rod-shaped particles translocating through the nanopore and how the current responds to it.

We report here the identification of a bona fide functional TMV MP PLS, which encompasses amino acid residues between positions 1 and 50, with residues Val-4 and Phe-14 potentially representing critical sites for PLS function that most likely affect protein conformation or protein interactions. We then demonstrated that this PLS is both necessary and sufficient for protein targeting to plasmodesmata.

Here, involvement of BRs in plant systemic resistance to virus was studied. Treatment of local leaves in Nicotiana benthamiana with BRs induced virus resistance in upper untreated leaves, accompanied by accumulations of H2O2 and NO. Scavenging of H2O2 or NO in upper leaves blocked BR-induced systemic virus resistance. BR-induced systemic H2O2 accumulation was blocked by local pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidase or silencing of respiratory burst oxidase homolog gene NbRBOHB, but not by systemic NADPH oxidase inhibition or NbRBOHA silencing. Silencing of the nitrite-dependent nitrate reductase gene NbNR or systemic pharmacological inhibition of NR compromised BR-triggered systemic NO accumulation, while local inhibition of NR, silencing of NbNOA1 and inhibition of NOS had little effect. Moreover, we provide evidence that BR-activated H2O2 is required for NO synthesis. Pharmacological scavenging or genetic inhibiting of H2O2 generation blocked BR-induced systemic NO production, but BR-induced H2O2 production was not sensitive to NO scavengers or silencing of NbNR. Systemically applied sodium nitroprusside rescued BR-induced systemic virus defense in NbRBOHB-silenced plants, but H2O2 did not reverse the effect of NbNR silencing on BR-induced systemic virus resistance. Finally, we demonstrate that the receptor kinase BRI1(BR insensitive 1) is an upstream component in BR-mediated systemic defense signaling, as silencing of NbBRI1 compromised the BR-induced H2O2 and NO production associated with systemic virus resistance. Together, our pharmacological and genetic data suggest the existence of a signaling pathway leading to BR-mediated systemic virus resistance that involves local Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog B (RBOHB)-dependent H2O2 production and subsequent systemic NR-dependent NO generation.",eng,2016,02,08,2016,1,11,ppublish,"Brassinosteroids|Disease Resistance|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Genes, Reporter|Hydrogen Peroxide|Models, Biological|NADPH Oxidases|Nitric Oxide|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plant Proteins|Reactive Oxygen Species|Signal Transduction|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D060406|D060467|D018506|D017930|D006861|D008954|D019255|D009569|D010935|D018515|D010940|D017382|D015398|D014026|D014027,Nicotiana benthamiana|brassinosteroids|hydrogen peroxide|nitric oxide|systemic virus resistance|virus-induced gene silencing

TSV purified from infected plants consists of a ss-RNA genome encapsidated in spheroidal particles with diameters of 27, 30 and 33nm constructed from multiple copies of a single species of coat protein (CP) subunits. Apart from protecting the viral genome, CPs of ilarviruses play several key roles in the life cycle of these viruses. Unlike the related bromo and cucumoviruses, ilarvirus particles are labile and pleomorphic, which has posed difficulties in their crystallization and structure determination. In the current study, a truncated TSV-CP was crystallized in two distinct forms and their structures were determined at resolutions of 2.4Ã and 2.1Ã, respectively. The core of TSV CP was found to possess the canonical Î²-barrel jelly roll tertiary structure observed in several other viruses. Dimers of CP with swapped C-terminal arms (C-arm) were observed in both the crystal forms. The C-arm was found to be flexible and is likely to be responsible for the polymorphic and pleomorphic nature of TSV capsids. Consistent with this observation, mutations in the hinge region of the C-arm that reduce the flexibility resulted in the formation of more uniform particles. TSV CP was found to be structurally similar to that of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) accounting for similar mechanism of genome activation in alfamo and ilar viruses.

To determine the importance of UPD and 3'-UTR, and the effects of introduced RNA elements in TMV 3'-UTR, a series of TMV mutants with internal poly(A) tract upstream of UPD was constructed for structural analysis by selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE). TMV(24A+UPD) and TMV(42A+UPD) formed a similar structure as that of TMV 3'-UTR, but TMV(62A+UPD) structures altered by the introduced poly(A) tract. In addition, TMV(24A+UPD) had a higher viral RNAs accumulation than TMV in N. benthamiana protoplasts, and induced lethal symptoms in the infected plants. TMV(62A+UPD) showed a drastically reduced accumulation, its coat protein was undetectable in protoplasts, and the inoculated plants remained symptomless. This study analyzed the structures of 3'-UTR of TMV and found that the longer poly(A) tract introduced upstream of UPD reduced viral RNAs accumulation and induced milder symptoms in N. benthamiana.

PepMV-induced diseases manifest with a wide range of symptoms, including systemic necrosis. Our results showed that PepMV accumulation depends on the virus isolate, tomato cultivar, and environmental conditions, and associates with the development of necrosis. Substitution of lysine for glutamic acid at position 67 in the triple gene block 3 (TGB3) protein, previously described as a necrosis determinant, led to increased virus accumulation and was necessary but not sufficient to induce systemic necrosis. Systemic necrosis both in tomato and Nicotiana benthamiana shared hypersensitive response (HR) features, allowing the assessment of the role of different genomic regions on necrosis induction. Overexpression of both TGB3 and the polymerase domain (POL) of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) resulted in necrosis, although only local expression of POL triggered HR-like symptoms. Our results also indicated that the necrosis-eliciting activity of POL resides in its highly conserved ""palm"" domain, and that necrosis was jasmonic acid-dependent but not salicylic acid-dependent. Altogether, our data suggest that the RdRp-POL domain plays an important role in PepMV necrosis induction, with necrosis development depending on the virus accumulation level, which can be modulated by the nature of TGB3, host genotype and environmental conditions.

The tomato production is being severely affected worldwide by Tospovirus. Some reports have been published about the association of plant virus and development of human disease either by direct or indirect consumption. Resistance to this virus has been identified as good source in wild tomato species (Lycopersicum peruvianum). But the introgression of resistance genes into cultivated tomato lines and the development of interspecific hybrid are hampered due to incompatibility, fertilization barriers and embryo abortion. But this barrier has been broken by applying the embryo rescue methods. This study describes the development of interspecific hybrid tomato plants by highly efficient embryo rescue method and screening for Tospovirus resistance. The interspecific hybrid tomato plants were developed by making a cross between wild tomato species (L. peruvianum) and cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The immature embryos were cultured in standardized medium and interspecific hybrids were developed from embryogenic callus. The immature embryos excised from 7 to 35Â days old fruits were used for embryo rescue and 31Â days old embryos showed very good germination capabilities and produced the highest number of plants. Developed plants were hardened enough and shifted to green house. The hybrid nature of interspecific plants was further confirmed by comparing the morphological characters from their parents. The F1, F2 and F3 plants were found to have varying characters especially for leaf type, color of stem, fruits, size, shapes and they were further screened for virus resistance both in lab and open field followed by Enzyme linked Immunosorbant Assay confirmation. Finally, a total of 11 resistant plants were selected bearing red color fruits with desired shape and size.

Although many eukaryotes express two eIF4G isoforms that are highly similar, the eIF4G isoforms in plants, referred to as eIF4G and eIFiso4G, are highly divergent in size, sequence, and domain organization but both can interact with eIF4A, eIF4B, eIF4E isoforms, and the poly(A)-binding protein. Nevertheless, eIF4G and eIFiso4G from wheat exhibit preferences in the mRNAs they translate optimally. For example, mRNA containing the 5'-leader (called Î©) of tobacco mosaic virus preferentially uses eIF4G in wheat germ lysate. In this study, the eIF4G isoform specificity of Î© was used to examine functional differences of the eIF4G isoforms in Arabidopsis. As in wheat, Î©-mediated translation was reduced in an eif4g null mutant. Loss of the eIFiso4G1 isoform, which is similar in sequence to wheat eIFiso4G, did not substantially affect Î©-mediated translation. However, loss of the eIFiso4G2 isoform substantially reduced Î©-mediated translation. eIFiso4G2 is substantially divergent from eIFiso4G1 and is present only in the Brassicaceae, suggesting a recent evolution. eIFiso4G2 isoforms exhibit sequence-specific differences in regions representing partner protein and RNA binding sites. Loss of any eIF4G isoform also resulted in a substantial reduction in reporter transcript level. These results suggest that eIFiso4G2 appeared late in plant evolution and exhibits more functional similarity with eIF4G than with eIFiso4G1 during Î©-mediated translation.

Our precedent observations suggested that DD11-39, DD38-11 and DD34-26 might play roles in the HR establishment. Only for DD11-39 a full-length cDNA sequence was obtained and the corresponding protein encoded for a type-HC RING-finger/putative E3 ligase protein which we termed NtRING1. The expression of NtRING1 was upregulated upon HR induction by elicitin, Ralstonia solanacearum, or tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in tobacco. Silencing of NtRING1 remarkably delayed the establishment of elicitin-induced HR in tobacco as well as the expression of different early induction genes in tissues undergoing HR.

A RhoA-derived peptide has been reported for over a decade as a potential inhibitor of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection both in vitro and in vivo and is anticipated to be a promising alternative to monoclonal antibody-based therapy against RSV infection. However, there are several challenges to furthering development of this antiviral peptide, including improvement in the peptideâs bioavailability, development of an efficient delivery system and identification of a cost-effective production platform. In this study, we have engineered a RhoA peptide as a genetic fusion to two carrier molecules, either lichenase (LicKM) or the coat protein (CP) of Alfalfa mosaic virus. These constructs were introduced into Nicotiana benthamiana plants using a tobacco mosaic virus-based expression vector and targets purified. The results demonstrated that the RhoA peptide fusion proteins were efficiently expressed in N. benthamiana plants, and that two of the resulting fusion proteins, RhoA-LicKM and RhoA2-FL-d25CP, inhibited RSV growth in vitro by 50 and 80 %, respectively.

For this purpose, dsRNA hairpin technology was used to reduce NbAGO2 expression in transgenic plants as verified with RT-PCR. This reduction was specific because the expression of other NbAGOs was not affected, and did not cause obvious developmental defects under normal growth conditions. Inoculation of transgenic plants with an otherwise silencing-sensitive GFP-expressing Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) variant resulted in high GFP accumulation because antiviral silencing was compromised. These transgenic plants also exhibited accelerated spread and/or enhanced susceptibility and symptoms for TBSV mutants defective for P19 or coat protein expression, other tombusviruses, Tobacco mosaic virus, and Potato virus X; but not noticeably for Foxtail mosaic virus. These findings support the notion that NbAGO2 in N. benthamiana can contribute to antiviral defense at different levels.

Currently, there is no methodology for continuously monitoring the environment for viruses in general, much less a methodology that allows the rapid and sensitive identification of a wide variety of viruses responsible for communicable diseases. Traditional approaches, based on PCR and immunodetection systems, only detect known or specifically targeted viruses. We here describe a simple device that can potentially detect any virus between nanogap electrodes using nonlinear impedance spectroscopy. Three test viruses, differing in shape and size, were used to demonstrate the general applicability of this approach: baculovirus, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and influenza virus. We show that each of the virus types responded differently in the nanogap to changes in the electric field strength, and the impedance of the virus solutions differed depending both on virus type and virus concentration. These preliminary results show that the three virus types can be distinguished and their approximate concentrations determined. Although further studies are required, the proposed nonlinear impedance spectroscopy method may achieve a sensitivity comparable to that of more traditional, but less versatile, virus detection systems.

BBWV2-PAP1 isolated from paprika (Capsicum annuum var. gulosum) induces severe disease symptoms in various pepper varieties, whereas BBWV2-RP1 isolated from red pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) causes mild symptoms. Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation of the infectious cDNA clones of BBWV2-PAP1 and RP1 resulted in the same symptoms as the original virus isolates.

In the case of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), the viral membrane protein 6K2 plays an essential role in endomembrane alterations. Although 6K2-induced membrane dynamics have been widely studied by confocal microscopy, the ultrastructure of this remodeling has not been extensively examined. In this study, we investigated the formation of TuMV-induced membrane changes by chemical fixation and high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution (HPF/FS) for transmission electron microscopy at different times of infection. We observed the formation of convoluted membranes connected to rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) early in the infection process, followed by the production of single-membrane vesicle-like (SMVL) structures at the midstage of infection. Both SMVL and double-membrane vesicle-like structures with electron-dense cores, as well as electron-dense bodies, were found late in the infection process. Immunogold labeling results showed that the vesicle-like structures were 6K2 tagged and suggested that only the SMVL structures were viral RNA replication sites. Electron tomography (ET) was used to regenerate a three-dimensional model of these vesicle-like structures, which showed that they were, in fact, tubules. Late in infection, we observed filamentous particle bundles associated with electron-dense bodies, which suggests that these are sites for viral particle assembly. In addition, TuMV particles were observed to accumulate in the central vacuole as membrane-associated linear arrays. Our work thus unravels the sequential appearance of distinct TuMV-induced membrane structures for viral RNA replication, viral particle assembly, and accumulation.",eng,2015,09,30,2015,10,2,ppublish,Endoplasmic Reticulum|Intracellular Membranes|Tobacco|Tymovirus|Vacuoles,D004721|D007425|D014026|D017806|D014617,

In this study, an up-regulated gene was identified and cloned from Nicotiana benthamiana plants after Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) inoculation. The up-regulated gene was identified as a member of the Rab small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) family, and was designated as NbRABG3f according to its inâsilico translated product with high identity to that of RABG3f of tomato. Knocking down the expression of NbRABG3f using a virus-induced gene silencing technique in a protoplast inoculation assay significantly reduced the accumulation of BaMV. A transiently expressed NbRABG3f protein in N.âbenthamiana plants followed by BaMV inoculation enhanced the accumulation of BaMV to approximately 150%. Mutants that had the catalytic site mutation (NbRABG3f/T22N) or had lost their membrane-targeting capability (NbRABG3f/ÎC3) failed to facilitate the accumulation of BaMV in plants. Because the Rab GTPase is responsible for vesicle trafficking between organelles, a mutant with a fixed guanosine diphosphate form was used to identify the donor compartment. The use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion revealed that GFP-NbRABG3f/T22N clearly co-localized with the Golgi marker. In conclusion, BaMV may use NbRABG3f to form vesicles derived from the Golgi membrane for intracellular trafficking to deliver unidentified factors to its replication site; thus, both GTPase activity and membrane-targeting ability are crucial for BaMV accumulation at the cell level.",eng,2015,11,11,2015,9,30,ppublish,"Amino Acid Sequence|DNA, Complementary|Down-Regulation|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Gene Knockdown Techniques|Golgi Apparatus|Green Fluorescent Proteins|Mosaic Viruses|Plant Diseases|Plant Proteins|Protoplasts|Subcellular Fractions|Tobacco|Up-Regulation|rab GTP-Binding Proteins",D000595|D018076|D015536|D018506|D055785|D006056|D049452|D009029|D010935|D010940|D011523|D013347|D014026|D015854|D020691,Bamboo mosaic virus|Golgi membrane|Rab GTPase|vesicle transport

SlSOBIR1 was transcriptionally modulated by unrelated viruses but its ectopic expression had no effect on virus accumulation. Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLK) constitute a diverse group of proteins allowing the cell to recognize and respond to the extracellular environment. In the present study we focused on a gene encoding a tomato LRR-RLK (named SlSOBIR1) involved in the host defense against fungal pathogens. Curiously, SlSOBIR1 has been previously reported to be down-regulated by Pepper yellow mosaic virus (PepYMV) infection. Here, we show that SlSOBIR1 is responsive to wounding and differentially modulated by unrelated virus infection, i.e., down-regulated by PepYMV and up-regulated by Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV). Despite these divergent expression profiles, SlSOBIR1 overexpression in transgenic tobacco plants had no evident effect on TCSV and PepYMV accumulation. On the other hand, overexpression of SlSOBIR1 significantly increased the expression of selected defense genes (PR-1a and PR-6) and exacerbated superoxide production in wounded leaves. Our data indicate that the observed modulation of SlSOBIR1 expression is probably triggered by secondary effects of the virus infection process and suggest that SlSOBIR1 is not directly involved in antiviral signaling response.",eng,2015,09,25,2015,9,27,ppublish,"Amino Acid Sequence|Gene Expression|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Lycopersicon esculentum|Phosphotransferases|Plant Diseases|Plant Immunity|Plant Leaves|Plant Proteins|Plants, Genetically Modified|Potyvirus|Tobacco|Tospovirus",D000595|D015870|D018506|D054884|D018551|D010770|D010935|D057865|D018515|D010940|D030821|D017800|D014026|D017865,Defense mechanisms|Plant-virus interactions|Receptor-like kinase|Tomato|Viruses

However, the mechanisms of AOX in the systemic antiviral defense response and N (a typical resistance gene)-mediated resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) are elusive. A chemical approach was undertaken to investigate the role of NbAOX in the systemic resistance to RNA viruses. Furthermore, we used a virus-induced gene-silencing (VIGS)-based genetics approach to investigate the function of AOX in the N-mediated resistance to TMV. The inoculation of virus significantly increased the NbAOX transcript and protein levels and the cyanide-resistant respiration in the upper un-inoculated leaves. Pretreatment with potassium cyanide greatly increased the plant's systemic resistance, whereas the application of salicylhydroxamic acid significantly compromised the plant's systemic resistance. Additionally, in NbAOX1a-silenced N-transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants, the inoculated leaf collapsed and the movement of TMV into the systemic tissue eventually led to the spreading of HR-PCD and the death of the whole plant. The hypersensitive response marker gene HIN1 was significantly increased in the NbAOX1a-silenced plants. Significant amounts of TMV-CP mRNA and protein were detected in the NbAOX1a-silenced plants but not in the control plants.

B,Viral nano-hybrids for innovative energy conversion and storage schemes.,10.1039/c5tb00924c,Typical rod-like viruses (the Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) and the Bacteriophage M13) are biological nanostructures that couple a 1D mono-dispersed morphology with a precisely defined topology of surface spaced and orthogonal reactive domains. These biogenic scaffolds offer a unique alternative to synthetic nano-platforms for the assembly of functional molecules and materials. Spatially resolved 1D arrays of inorganic-organic hybrid domains can thus be obtained on viral nano-templates resulting in the functional arrangement of photo-triggers and catalytic sites with applications in light energy conversion and storage. Different synthetic strategies are herein highlighted depending on the building blocks and with a particular emphasis on the molecular design of viral-templated nano-interfaces holding great potential for the dream-goal of artificial photosynthesis.,eng,2015,07,06,2015,9,7,ppublish,,,

In the original formulation the mask typically used in these applications had to be separated into a working and a testing area. Here we present a variant of the calculation of the M-free score, which under certain conditions does not require adapting the mask used during the processing. This is made possible by a modified algorithm that allows for arbitrary variances in the testing and in the working area. Consequently, the reference bias can be estimated with knowledge of only the starting reference, the final average and the mask used for processing. We show that the new formulation of the M-free score gives a reliable measure of the reference bias for any sub-tomogram average that has ancillary data, such as when the averaged structure contains density in the periphery, when a complex is attached to a membrane (membrane-associated complexes) or when one subunit is attached to others (e.g. in viruses). Further, we show that in contrast to correlation-based measurements, the M-free score is sensitive to wrong-alignments and contaminations present in the data set. The scope of this new calculation of the M-free score is to reduce the constraints of the previous approach and in certain cases to avoid an adaptation of the mask. The M-free score gives a separate reliability measure for sub-tomogram averaging and template matching.

Studies of these associations typically focus on tripartite interactions between a plant host, a plant pathogen, and its insect vector. An unrelated herbivore or pathogen might influence such interactions. This study used a model system consisting of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the psyllid Bactericera cockerelli Sulc, and tomatoes to investigate multipartite interactions among a pathogen, a nonvector, and a plant host, and determine whether shifts in host physiology were behind potential interactions. Additionally, the ability of TMV to affect the success of another pathogen, 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum,' which is transmitted by the psyllid, was studied. In choice trials, psyllids preferred nearly fourfold noninfected plants to TMV-infected plants. No-choice bioassays demonstrated that there was no difference in psyllid development between TMV-infected and control plants; oviposition was twice as high on control plants. Following inoculation by psyllids, 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' titers were lower in TMV-infected plants than control plants. TMV-infected plants had lower levels of amino acids and sugars but little differences in phenolics and terpenoids, relative to control plants. Possibly, these changes in sugars are associated with a reduction in psyllid attractiveness in TMV-infected tomatoes resulting in decreased infection of 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum.'",eng,2015,05,26,2015,8,28,ppublish,Animals|Feeding Behavior|Hemiptera|Lycopersicon esculentum|Plant Diseases|Rhizobiaceae|Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D000818|D005247|D006430|D018551|D010935|D012230|D014027,Bactericera cockerelli|Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum|multipartite interaction|pathogen competition|pathogen transmission

We found that at 30Â°C, accumulation of the CMV isolate and infection symptoms remained comparable to those at 25Â°C, whereas accumulation of the PVY isolate and those of the three PVX constructs decreased markedly, even when expressing the heterologous suppressors 2b or HCPro, and plants had either very attenuated or no symptoms. Under elevated CO2 plants grew larger, but contained less total protein/unit of leaf area. In contrast to temperature, infection symptoms remained unaltered for the five viruses at elevated CO2 levels, but viral titers in leaf disks as a proportion of the total protein content increased in all cases, markedly for CMV, and less so for PVY and the PVX constructs. Despite these differences, we found that neither high temperature nor elevated CO2 prevented efficient suppression of silencing by their viral suppressors in agropatch assays.

LS-CMV variants carrying mimic sequences were generated by co-infiltrating plants with Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells harboring engineered RNA3 with cells carrying RNA1 and RNA2 infectious clones. The utility of using agroinfection to deliver LS-CMV-derived microRNA target mimic sequences was demonstrated using a miR165/166 target mimic and three solanaceous hosts: Nicotiana benthamiana, tobacco (N. tabacum), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). In all three hosts the miR165/166 target mimic induced marked changes in developmental phenotype. Inhibition of miRNA accumulation and increased target mRNA (HD-ZIP III) accumulation was demonstrated in tomato.

In recent years, numerous investigations demonstrated the tremendous potential of marine fungi as a promising source to develop new antivirals against different important viruses, including herpes simplex viruses, the human immunodeficiency virus, and the influenza virus. Various genera of marine fungi such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cladosporium, and Fusarium were subjected to compound isolation and antiviral studies, which led to an illustration of the strong antiviral activity of a variety of marine fungi-derived compounds.

The goal is an effective, bioinspired fabrication of fiber-reinforced composites and robust, miniaturized technical devices. Major challenges in the synthesis of applicable mineralized nanorods lie in selectivity and adjustability of the inorganic material deposited on the biological, rod-shaped backbones, with respect to thickness and surface profile of the resulting coating, as well as the avoidance of aggregation into extended superstructures. Nanotubular tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) templates have proved particularly suitable towards this goal: Their multivalent protein coating can be modified by high-surface-density conjugation of peptides, inducing and governing silica deposition from precursor solutions in vitro. In this study, TMV has been equipped with mineralization-directing peptides designed to yield silica coatings in a reliable and predictable manner via precipitation from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) precursors. Three peptide groups were compared regarding their influence on silica polymerization: (i) two peptide variants with alternating basic and acidic residues, i.e. lysine-aspartic acid (KD) x motifs expected to act as charge-relay systems promoting TEOS hydrolysis and silica polymerization; (ii) a tetrahistidine-exposing polypeptide (CA4H4) known to induce silicification due to the positive charge of its clustered imidazole side chains; and (iii) two peptides with high ZnO binding affinity. Differential effects on the mineralization of the TMV surface were demonstrated, where a (KD) x charge-relay peptide (designed in this study) led to the most reproducible and selective silica deposition. A homogenous coating of the biotemplate and tight control of shell thickness were achieved.

There are considerable regulatory challenges to consider in commercialization of plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs), some of which are inherent to plant-production systems and others that are common with other production systems, but are new to PMPs because of the youth of the industry. In this review, we discuss our recent and ongoing experience with bulk production of the HIV microbicide candidate, griffithsin (GRFT), utilizing plant-based transient protein expression, with specific focus on areas relevant to commercial manufacturing of bulk GRFT active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Analytical programs have been developed for the qualification and monitoring of both the expression vector system and the API detailing our experience and plans for each. Monitoring postpurification protein modifications are discussed in relation to stability and safety programs. Expression, processing and analytics programs are associated with increased manufacturing costs in current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) production because of the required qualification testing. The impact of these costs on the overall cost of goods is particularly relevant to GRFT manufacturing because GRFT, as an HIV microbicide, is most needed in populations at high risk for HIV exposure in resource-poor countries. Consequently, GRFT for microbicide applications is a very cost-sensitive recombinant PMP. We have therefore emphasized maintaining a low cost of goods. We provide a review of the literature on the economics of PMPs with various expression systems and how they may impact production costs and complexity.

The systemic infection was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and Western blot analysis. Simultaneously, soybean, tomato, and Arabidopsis ecotype Estland were mechanically inoculated with sap prepared from TRSV-agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana leaves, showing typical symptoms of bud blight, necrotic spots, and lethal systemic necrosis, respectively.

A breeding strategy based on resistance genes is an effective method for improving TMV resistance in tobacco. Also, the physiological status of plants is also critical to disease resistance improvement. Potassium ion is one of the most abundant inorganic nutrients in plant cells, and mediates plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Improving K+ content in soil by fertilising can enhance diseases resistance of crops. However, the K+ absorption in plants depends mostly on K+ transporters located in cytoplasmic membrane. Therefore, the encoding genes for K+ transporters are putative candidates to target for improving tobacco mosaic virus resistance. In this work, the synergistic effect of a N-like resistance gene CN and a tobacco putative potassium transporter gene HAK1 was studied. The results showed that TMV-resistance in CN-HAK1-containing tobaccos was significantly enhanced though a of strengthening leaf thickness and reduction in the size of necrotic spots compared with only CN-containing plants, indicating the improvement of potassium nutrition in plant cells could increase the tobacco resistance to TMV by reducing the spread of the virus. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis for TMV-CP expression in the inoculated leaf of the transgenic and wild-type plants also supported the conclusion. Further, the results of defence-related determination including antioxidative enzymes (AOEs) activity, salicylic acid (SA) content and the expression of resistance-related genes demonstrated CN with HAK1 synergistically enhanced TMV-resistance in transgenic tobaccos. Additionally, the HAK1- overexpression significantly improved the photosynthesis and K+-enriching ability in trans-CN-HAK1 tobaccos, compared with other counterparts.

PIPO is expressed as part of a frameshift protein, P3N-PIPO, which is essential for virus cell-to-cell movement. However, the frameshift expression mechanism has hitherto remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that transcriptional slippage, specific to the viral RNA polymerase, results in a population of transcripts with an additional ""A"" inserted within a highly conserved GAAAAAA sequence, thus enabling expression of P3N-PIPO. The slippage efficiency is ~2% in Turnip mosaic virus and slippage is inhibited by mutations in the GAAAAAA sequence.

The method is based on the recently developed picosecond infrared laser (PIRL), designed specifically to provide matrix-free extraction by selectively exciting the water vibrational modes under the condition of ultrafast desorption by impulsive vibrational excitation (DIVE). The basic concept is to extract the constituent protein structures on the fastest impulsive limit for ablation to avoid excessive thermal heating of the proteins and to use strongly resonant 1-photon conditions to avoid multiphoton ionization and degradation of the sample integrity. With various microscope imaging and biochemical analysis methods, nanoscale single protein molecules, viruses, and cells in the ablation plume are found to be morphologically and functionally identical with their corresponding controls. This method provides a new means to resolve chemical activity within cells and is amenable to subcellular imaging with near-field approaches.

F. tularensis is classified as a Category A Biothreat agent by the CDC based on its use in bioweapon programs by several countries in the past and its potential to be used as an agent of bioterrorism. No licensed vaccine is currently available for prevention of tularemia. In this study, we used a novel approach for development of a multivalent subunit vaccine against tularemia by using an efficient tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) based delivery platform. The multivalent subunit vaccine was formulated to contain a combination of F. tularensis protective antigens: OmpA-like protein (OmpA), chaperone protein DnaK and lipoprotein Tul4 from the highly virulent F. tularensis SchuS4 strain. Two different vaccine formulations and immunization schedules were used. The immunized mice were challenged with lethal (10xLD100) doses of F. tularensis LVS on day 28 of the primary immunization and observed daily for morbidity and mortality. Results from this study demonstrate that TMV can be used as a carrier for effective delivery of multiple F. tularensis antigens. TMV-conjugate vaccine formulations are safe and multiple doses can be administered without causing any adverse reactions in immunized mice. Immunization with TMV-conjugated F. tularensis proteins induced a strong humoral immune response and protected mice against respiratory challenges with very high doses of F. tularensis LVS. This study provides a proof-of-concept that TMV can serve as a suitable platform for simultaneous delivery of multiple protective antigens of F. tularensis. Refinement of vaccine formulations coupled with TMV-targeting strategies developed in this study will provide a platform for development of an effective tularemia subunit vaccine as well as a vaccination approach that may broadly be applicable to many other bacterial pathogens.

Little is known about the forces that model the ER during cell plate formation. Here, we show that members of the reticulon (RTNLB) family of ER-tubulating proteins in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) may play a role in the formation of the desmotubule. RTNLB3 and RTNLB6, two RTNLBs present in the PD proteome, are recruited to the cell plate at late telophase, when primary PD are formed, and remain associated with primary PD in the mature cell wall. Both RTNLBs showed significant colocalization at PD with the viral movement protein of Tobacco mosaic virus, while superresolution imaging (three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy) of primary PD revealed the central desmotubule to be labeled by RTNLB6. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching studies showed that these RTNLBs are mobile at the edge of the developing cell plate, where new wall materials are being delivered, but significantly less mobile at its center, where PD are forming. A truncated RTNLB3, unable to constrict the ER, was not recruited to the cell plate at cytokinesis. We discuss the potential roles of RTNLBs in desmotubule formation.

In addition, the levels of TMV-capsid protein (CP) transcripts decreased in distant leaves, indicating that sulfated lentinan induces systemic protection against TMV. The activities of the defense enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and lipoxygenase (LOX) and the amounts of several phenylpropanoid compounds (PPCs) were measured in control and treated plants without infection. A progressive increase in PAL activity was observed with increasing time after treatment, together with the accumulation of free and conjugated PPCs. In contrast, LOX activity remained unchanged. Interestingly, the increase in PAL activity showed a linear correlation with the decrease in necrotic lesions and the decrease in TMV-CP transcript level.

Using a highly tunable synthetic platform combined with transient absorption and time-resolved fluorescence measurements and molecular dynamics simulations, we interrogate isolated chromophores covalently linked to different positions in the interior of the hydrated nanoscale cavity of a supramolecular protein assembly. We find that, following photoexcitation, the time scales over which these chromophores are solvated, undergo conformational rearrangements, and return to the ground state are highly sensitive to their position within this cavity and are significantly slower than in a bulk aqueous solution. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the hindered translations and rotations of water molecules within the protein cavity with spatial specificity. The results presented herein show that fully hydrated nanoscale protein cavities are a promising way to mimic the tight protein pockets found in natural light-harvesting complexes.

To replicate, (+)RNA viruses exploit host resources and modify host metabolism and membrane organization. Phospholipase D (PLD) is a phosphatidylcholine- and phosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolyzing enzyme that catalyzes the production of phosphatidic acid (PA), a lipid second messenger that modulates diverse intracellular signaling in various organisms. PA is normally present in small amounts (less than 1% of total phospholipids), but rapidly and transiently accumulates in lipid bilayers in response to different environmental cues such as biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. However, the precise functions of PLD and PA remain unknown. Here, we report the roles of PLD and PA in genomic RNA replication of a plant (+)RNA virus, Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV). We found that RCNMV RNA replication complexes formed in Nicotiana benthamiana contained PLDÎ± and PLDÎ². Gene-silencing and pharmacological inhibition approaches showed that PLDs and PLDs-derived PA are required for viral RNA replication. Consistent with this, exogenous application of PA enhanced viral RNA replication in plant cells and plant-derived cell-free extracts. We also found that a viral auxiliary replication protein bound to PA in vitro, and that the amount of PA increased in RCNMV-infected plant leaves. Together, our findings suggest that RCNMV hijacks host PA-producing enzymes to replicate.

Although AC5/C5 coding sequences are increasingly annotated in databases for many begomoviruses, the evolutionary relationships and functions of this putative protein in viral infection are obscure. Here, we demonstrate several important functions of the AC5 protein of a bipartite begomovirus, Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV). Mutational analyses and transgenic expression showed that AC5 plays a critical role in MYMIV infection. Ectopic expression of AC5 from a Potato virus X (PVX) vector resulted in severe mosaic symptoms followed by a hypersensitive-like response in Nicotiana benthamiana. Furthermore, MYMIV AC5 effectively suppressed post-transcriptional gene silencing induced by single-stranded but not double-stranded RNA. AC5 was also able to reverse transcriptional gene silencing of a green fluorescent protein transgene by reducing methylation of promoter sequences, probably through repressing expression of a CHH cytosine methyltransferase (DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE2) in N.Â benthamiana. Our results demonstrate that MYMIV AC5 is a pathogenicity determinant and a potent RNA silencing suppressor that employs novel mechanisms to suppress antiviral defenses, and suggest that the AC5 function may be conserved among many begomoviruses.

However, little information is available about how these activities are regulated by post-translational modifications. In this study, we showed that the BSMV Xinjiang strain TGB1 (XJTGB1) is phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro by protein kinase CK2 from barley and Nicotiana benthamiana. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis and in vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that Thr-401 is the major phosphorylation site of the XJTGB1 protein, and suggested that a Thr-395 kinase docking site supports Thr-401 phosphorylation. Substitution of Thr-395 with alanine (T395A) only moderately impaired virus cell-to-cell movement and systemic infection. In contrast, the Thr-401 alanine (T401A) virus mutant was unable to systemically infect N. benthamiana but had only minor effects in monocot hosts. Substitution of Thr-395 or Thr-401 with aspartic acid interfered with monocot and dicot cell-to-cell movement and the plants failed to develop systemic infections. However, virus derivatives with single glutamic acid substitutions at Thr-395 and Thr-401 developed nearly normal systemic infections in the monocot hosts but were unable to infect N. benthamiana systemically, and none of the double mutants was able to infect dicot and monocot hosts. The mutant XJTGB1T395A/T401A weakened in vitro interactions between XJTGB1 and XJTGB3 proteins but had little effect on XJTGB1 RNA-binding ability. Taken together, our results support a critical role of CK2 phosphorylation in the movement of BSMV in monocots and dicots, and provide new insights into the roles of phosphorylation in TGB protein functions.

In this study, we focused on the involvement of NtERF3 in a cell death signalling pathway in tobacco plants, particularly downstream of NtSIPK/NtWIPK and NtWRKY1, which are mitogen-activated protein kinases and a phosphorylation substrate of NtSIPK, respectively. An ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif-deficient NtERF3b mutant (NtERF3bÎEAR) that lacked cell death-inducing ability suppressed the induction of cell death caused by NtERF3a.

In this study, serial deletion and point-mutation mutagenesis of conserved regions (CR) of NSs protein were performed, and the silencing suppression function was analyzed through agroinfiltration in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. We found two amino acid (aa) residues, H113 and Y398, are novel functional residues for RNA silencing suppression. Our further analyses demonstrated that H113 at the common epitope (CE) ((109)KFTMHNQ(117)), which is highly conserved in Asia type tospoviruses, and the benzene ring of Y398 at the C-terminal Î²-sheet motif ((397)IYFL(400)) affect NSs mRNA stability and protein stability, respectively, and are thus critical for NSs RNA silencing suppression. Additionally, protein expression of other six deleted (ÎCR1-ÎCR6) and five point-mutated (Y15A, Y27A, G180A, R181A and R212A) mutants were hampered and their silencing suppression ability was abolished.

Here, we report a novel 5' regulatory sequence (Eriubi D7) of the ubiquitin gene from Erianthus arundinaceus, a wild relative of sugarcane resistant to many biotic and abiotic stresses. A 3.2-kb regulatory sequence of ubiquitin gene was isolated through random amplification of genomic ends technique and characterized in rice, tobacco, and sugarcane. In silico analysis revealed that the regulatory sequence contained a promoter region of 1600Â bp upstream to the transcription start site. Between the promoter and the coding region, two putative introns of 584 and 583Â bp and two putative non-coding exons of 459 and 37Â bp were spaced alternatively. To identify the active domains required for gene regulation, 12 truncations/recombinants were made in the regulatory sequence and characterized in heterologous systems. Transformation studies with the recombinant constructs revealed that Eriubi D7, a truncated fragment containing 830Â bp promoter and the intron I, conferred enhanced GUS reporter gene expression in both monocots and dicots compared to other routinely used promoters such as maize ubi1 and Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S. Further analysis confirms that this regulatory sequence is quite distinct from the other reported ubiquitin promoters and was also found to enhance expression of the reporter gene upon wounding.

The viral unit in these movements can be a virion or a yet-to-be-defined ribonucleic protein (RNP) complex. Using live-cell imaging, our laboratory has previously demonstrated that membrane-bound replication complexes move cell-to-cell during turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infection. Our recent study shows that these membrane-bound replication complexes end up in the vascular conducting tubes, which is likely the case for potato virus X (PVX) also. The presence of TuMV-induced membrane complexes in xylem vessels suggests that viral components could also be found in other apoplastic regions of the plant, such as the intercellular space. This possibility may have implications regarding how we approach the study of plant innate immune responses against viruses.

Recent studies of the movement mechanisms of BaMV have revealed similarities and differences between BaMV and other potexviruses. This review focuses on the general aspects of viral and host elements involved in BaMV movement, the interactions among these elements, and the possible pathways for intra- and intercellular trafficking of BaMV. Major features of BaMV trafficking that have not been demonstrated in other potexviruses include: (i) the involvement of replicase, (ii) fine regulation by coat protein phosphorylation, (iii) the key roles played by TGBp3, (iv) the use of virions as the major transported form, and (v) the involvement of specific host factors, such as Ser/Thr kinase-like protein of Nicotiana benthamiana. We also highlight areas for future study that will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the detailed interactions among viral movement proteins and host factors, as well as the regulatory mechanisms of virus movement. Finally, a model based on the current knowledge is proposed to depict the diverse abilities of BaMV to utilize a wide range of mechanisms for efficient intercellular movement.

Promoter elements from these dahlia-associated pararetroviruses were identified and characterized. The TATA box, the CAAT box, the transcription start site, the polyadenylation signal, and regulation factors, characteristic of caulimovirus promoters, were present in each of these promoter regions. Each of the promoter regions was separately cloned into a binary vector containing Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and delivered into Agrobacterium tumefaciens by electroporation followed by agroinfiltration into Nicotiana benthamiana. The activity of the 35S promoter homologs was determined by transient expression of the GUS gene both in qualitative and quantitative assays. The length of the promoter regions in DMV, DCMV, and DvEPRS corresponded to 438, 439, and 259 bp, respectively. Quantitative GUS assays showed that the promoters from DMV and DCMV resulted in higher levels of gene expression compared to that of DvEPRS in N. benthamiana leaf tissue. Significant differences were observed among the three promoters (p < 0.001). Qualitative GUS assays were consistent with quantitative GUS results.

In this paper, we report the usage of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) as a carrier for the display of the small molecule estriol (E3), a weakly immunogenic hapten. A highly efficient copper (I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC) was performed for the conjugation of E3 onto TMV capsid at tyrosine (Tyr) 139, by which the antigen density could be controlled. The immune properties of these constructs were evaluated in mice. We found that a strong and long-term antibody response was elicited by conjugating a high density of small molecular haptens on TMV through an oligo(ethylene glycol) (OEG) linker, likely due to the effective activation of B-cells. This study suggests that TMV can serve as a promising platform to induce strong humoral immune responses and that the optimized conjugation strategy was critical to produce high quality antibodies.

Abamectin (Abm) is a biological pesticide with a strong activity against a wide variety of plant parasitic nematodes. However, Abm's poor mobility in the soil compromises its nematicide performance because of the limited zone of protection surrounding the growing root system of the plant. In this study, we manipulated Abm's soil physical chemistry by encapsulating Abm within the Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) to produce a plant virus nanoparticle (PVN) delivery system for Abm. The transmission electron microscopic and dynamic light scattering characterization of Abm-loaded PVN (PVN(Abm)) indicated the resultant viral capsid integrity and morphology comparable to native RCNMV. In addition, the PVN(Abm) significantly increased Abm's soil mobility while enabling a controlled release strategy for Abm's bioavailability to nematodes. As a result, PVN(Abm) enlarged the zone of protection from Meloidogyne hapla root knot nematodes in the soil as compared to treating with free Abm molecules. Tomato seedlings treated with PVN(Abm) had healthier root growth and a reduction in root galling demonstrating the success of this delivery system for the increased efficacy of Abm to control nematode damage in crops.

Such nanoparticles exhibit a range of nanoscale properties such as surface plasmon resonance (nobel metals e.g. Au), fluorescence (semiconductor quantum dots e.g. CdSe) and nanomagnetism (magnetic alloys e.g. CoPt and iron oxides e.g. magnetite), which are currently the subject of intensive research for their applicability in diagnostic and therapeutic nanomedicine. For such applications, MBNPs are required to be biocompatible, of a precise size and shape for a consistent signal or output and be easily modified with biomolecules for applications. Ideally the MBNPs would be obtained via an environmentally-friendly synthetic route. A biological or biologically inspired nanoreactor synthesis of MBNPs is shown to address these issues. Biological nanoreactors for crystallizing MBNPs within cells (magnetosomes), protein cages (ferritin) and virus capsids (cowpea chlorotic mottle, cowpea mosaic and tobacco mosaic viruses), are discussed along with how these have been modified for applications and for the next generation of new materials. Biomimetic liposome, polymersome and even designed self-assembled proteinosome nanoreactors are also reviewed for MBNP crystallisation and further modification for applications.

An annexin-like gene was isolated from the cereal cyst nematode Heterodera avenae (termed Ha-annexin) and had high similarity to annexin 2, which encodes a secreted protein of Globodera pallida. Ha-annexin encodes a predicted 326 amino acid protein containing four conserved annexin domains. Southern blotting revealed that there are at least two homologies in the H. avenae genome. Ha-annexin transcripts were expressed within the subventral gland cells of the pre-parasitic second-stage juveniles by in situ hybridization. Additionally, expression of these transcripts were relatively higher in the parasitic second-stage juveniles by quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis, coinciding with the time when feeding cell formation is initiated. Knockdown of Ha-annexin by method of barley stripe mosaic virus-based host-induced gene silencing (BSMV-HIGS) caused impaired nematode infections at 7 dpi and reduced females at 40 dpi, indicating important roles of the gene in parasitism at least in early stage in vivo. Transiently expression of Ha-ANNEXIN in onion epidermal cells and Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells showed the whole cell-localization.

However, how ROS regulates autophagy in response to oxidative stresses is largely unknown. Here, we show that autophagy-related protein 3 (ATG3) interacts with the cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPCs) to regulate autophagy in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. We found that oxidative stress inhibits the interaction of ATG3 with GAPCs. Silencing of GAPCs significantly activates ATG3-dependent autophagy, while overexpression of GAPCs suppresses autophagy in N. benthamiana plants.

In recent years, many virus-inorganic materials have been synthesized as a means to produce high quality nanomaterials. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in virus coating have not been sufficiently studied to allow for directed synthesis. We combined XAS, via XANES and EXAFS analysis, with TEM to confirm an autocatalytic reduction mechanism mediated by the TMV1Cys surface. This reduction interestingly proceeds via two first order regimes which result in two linear growth regimes as spherical palladium nanoparticles are formed. By combining this result with particle growth data, it was discovered that the first regime describes growth of palladium nanoparticles on the virion while the second regime describes a second layer of larger particles which grew sporadically on the first palladium nanoparticle layer. Subsequent aggregation of free solution based spherical particles and metallized nanorods characterize a third and final regime. At the end of the second reduction regime, the average particle diameter of particles tethered to the TMV1Cys surface are approximately 4.5 nm. The use of XAS to simultaneously monitor the kinetics of biotemplated reactions along with growth of metal nanoparticles will provide insight into the pertinent reduction and growth mechanisms so that nanorod properties can be controlled through their populating nanoparticles.",eng,2015,03,10,2015,3,25,ppublish,Cysteine|Metal Nanoparticles|Oxidation-Reduction|Palladium|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Virion,D003545|D053768|D010084|D010165|D014027|D014771,Hydrothermal synthesis|In situ|Mineralization|Reduction|Tobacco mosaic virus|X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS)

GUS activity in individual plant cells driven by Rep, CP and 35S promoters was estimated using real-time PCR and fluorometric GUS assay. Histochemical staining of GUS in transformed tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi) leaves showed highest expression driven by Rep promoter followed by 35S promoter and CP promoter. The expression level of GUS driven by Rep promoter in transformed tobacco plants was shown to be two to four-fold higher than that of 35S promoter, while the expression by CP promoter was slightly lower. Further, the expression of GFP was monitored in agroinfiltrated leaves of N. benthamiana, N. tabacum and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) plants using confocal laser scanning microscopy.

Resistance breaking can probably be attributed to multiple mutations observed to accumulate in the capsid protein (CP) region of resistance-breaking isolates, but this has not been confirmed through directed manipulation of an infectious PepMV clone. The present work describes the introduction of two specific mutations, A-T78 and A-T114, into the coat protein minimal elicitor region of an Rx-controlled PepMV isolate of the EU genotype. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and phenotypic evaluation were conducted in three Rx-expressing and wild-type solanaceous hosts: Nicotiana benthamiana, Nicotiana tabacum and Solanum lycopersicum. Mutation A-T78 alone was sufficient to confer Rx-breaking activity in N.âbenthamiana and S.âlycopersicum, whereas mutation A-T114 was found to be associated, in most cases, with a secondary A-D100 mutation to break Rx-mediated resistance in S.âlycopersicum. These results suggest that the need for a second, fitness-restoring mutation may be dependent on the PepMV mutant under consideration. Both mutations conferred Rx breaking in S.âlycopersicum, whereas neither conferred Rx breaking in N.âtabacum and only A-T78 allowed Rx breaking in N.âbenthamiana, suggesting that Rx may function in a different manner depending on the genetic background in which it is present.

We performed cytological, physiological and molecular biological analyses of the DGIs and LGTs in cucumber mosaic virus-infected Nicotiana tabacum leaves. Our results indicated that the DGIs contained less virus than did the LGTs. Compared to the LGTs, the DGIs contained higher levels of the metabolites involved in plant defence. The contents of reduced glutathione and ascorbic acid were increased in the DGIs to reach levels that were even higher than those of control plants. Moreover, hormone measurements and quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the endogenous salicylic acid, ethylene and defence genes mediated these elevations by playing positive roles in the regulation of the DGIs responses to viral infection. The accumulation of cytokinin was also much greater in the DGIs than in the LGTs. Finally, northern blotting analysis indicated that the accumulation of viral small interfering RNAs was decreased in the DGIs compared to the LGTs.

This aspect of viral infection appears to be important for the adaptation and survival of viruses. To clarify how the number of viral genomes that establish cell infection is determined, we developed a simulation model of cell infection for tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), a positive-strand RNA virus. The model showed that stochastic processes that govern the replication or degradation of individual genomes result in the infection by a small number of genomes, while a large number of infectious genomes are introduced in the cell. It also predicted two interesting characteristics regarding cell infection patterns: stochastic variation among cells in the number of viral genomes that establish infection and stochastic inequality in the accumulation of their progenies in each cell. Both characteristics were validated experimentally by inoculating tobacco cells with a library of nucleotide sequence-tagged ToMV and analyzing the viral genomes that accumulated in each cell using a high-throughput sequencer. An additional simulation model revealed that these two characteristics enhance selection during tissue infection. The cell infection model also predicted a mechanism that enhances selection at the cellular level: a small difference in the replication abilities of coinfected variants results in a large difference in individual accumulation via the multiple-round formation of the replication complex (i.e., the replication machinery). Importantly, this predicted effect was observed in vivo. The cell infection model was robust to changes in the parameter values, suggesting that other viruses could adopt similar adaptation mechanisms. Taken together, these data reveal a comprehensive picture of viral infection processes including replication, cell-to-cell transmission, and evolution, which are based on the stochastic behavior of the viral genome molecules in each cell.

The secondary structure of the entire genomic RNA of satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) was recently determined by selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE). The SHAPE analysis suggested a single highly extended secondary structure with much less branching than occurs in the ensemble of structures predicted by purely thermodynamic algorithms. Here we examine the solution-equilibrated STMV genome by direct visualization with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), using an RNA of similar length transcribed from the yeast genome as a control.

Thus, our results both elucidate the statistical nature of the secondary structure of large ss-RNAs and give visual support for modern RNA structure determination methods. Additionally, this work introduces cryo-EM as a means to distinguish between competing secondary structure models if the models differ significantly in terms of the number and/or length of branches.

A 30 kDa protein was isolated as the active component, called BDP-30 on the basis of the molecular weight and source plant. BDP-30, a glycoprotein, was found to be temperature and protease resistant. It was basic, possessing a pI greater than 9.0. In-gel proteolytic digestion of BDP-30 generated two peptides that possessed the amino acid sequence KLYDIPPLR and KVTLPYSGNYER by LC/MS/MS. Both peptides shared absolute sequence identity with trichosanthin, a ribosome-inactivating protein from Trichosanthes kirilowii, and a 78 percent and 100 percent homology respectively with an RIP from Bryonia dioica, bryodin. Further, effort was made to look at the fate of TMV in induced resistant Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi, a systemic host of the virus, at specified days after inoculation in control and treated plants. TMV coat protein (CP) was detected by immunoblot 7 days post inoculation up to 21 days in the control set, but not in treated resistant plants. TMV RNA was detected by RT-PCR using TMV-CP specific primers. Resistant tobacco did not show presence of TMV RNA up to 21 days of inoculation. This suggests that BDP-30 may be suppressing TMV replication.

Currently, there are eleven recognized species of CMGs, and several diverse isolates represent them, with vast amount of sequence variability, reflecting into diversity of symptom severity/phenotypes. Here, we make a systematic effort to study the infection dynamics of several species of CMGs and their isolates. Further, we try to identify the genomic component of CMGs contributing to the manifestation of diverse patterns of symptoms and the molecular basis for the differential behavior of CMGs. The pseudo-recombination studies carried out by swapping of DNA-A and DNA-B components of the CMGs revealed that the DNA-B component significantly contributes to the symptom severity. Past studies had shown that the DNA-A component of Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus shows monopartite feature. Thus, the ability of DNA-A component alone, to replicate and move systemically in the host plant with inherent monopartite features was investigated for all the CMGs. Geminiviruses are known to trigger gene silencing and are also its target, resulting in recovery of the host plant from viral infection. In the collection of several different CMG species and isolates we had, there was a vast variability in their recovery and non-recovery phenotypes. To understand the molecular basis of this, the origin and distribution of virus-derived small interfering RNAs were mapped across their genome and across the CMG-infected symptomatic Nicotiana benthamiana.

This new tool increases the possibility of observing mixed infections caused by combinations of plant viruses, which are likely to occur more frequently than previously thought. The biological impact of co-infecting viruses on their host has yet to be determined and fully understood, and the first step towards reaching this goal is the separation and purification of individual species. Ion-exchange monolith chromatography has been used successfully for the purification and concentration of different viruses, and number of them have been separated from plant homogenate or bacterial and eukaryotic lysate. Thus, the question remained as to whether different virus species present in a single sample could be separated. In this study, anion-exchange chromatography using monolithic supports was optimized for fast and efficient partial purification of three model plant viruses: Turnip yellow mosaic virus, Tomato bushy stunt virus, and Tobacco mosaic virus. The virus species, as well as two virus strains, were separated from each other in a single chromatographic experiment from an artificially mixed sample. Based on A260/280 ratios, we were able to attribute specific peaks to a certain viral morphology/structure (icosahedral or rod-shaped). This first separation of individual viruses from an artificially prepared laboratory mixture should encourage new applications of monolithic chromatographic supports in the separation of plant, bacterial, or animal viruses from all kinds of mixed samples.

They move as virions or as ribonucleic protein complexes, although it is not clear what these complexes are made of. The approximately 10-kb RNA genome of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) encodes a membrane protein, known as 6K2, that induces endomembrane rearrangements for the formation of viral replication factories. These factories take the form of vesicles that contain viral RNA (vRNA) and viral replication proteins. In this study, we report the presence of 6K2-tagged vesicles containing vRNA and the vRNA-dependent RNA polymerase in phloem sieve elements and in xylem vessels. Transmission electron microscopy observations showed the presence in the xylem vessels of vRNA-containing vesicles that were associated with viral particles. Stem-girdling experiments, which leave xylem vessels intact but destroy the surrounding tissues, confirmed that TuMV could establish a systemic infection of the plant by going through xylem vessels. Phloem sieve elements and xylem vessels from Potato virus X-infected plants also contained lipid-associated nonencapsidated vRNA, indicating that the presence of membrane-associated ribonucleic protein complexes in the phloem and xylem may not be limited to TuMV. Collectively, these studies indicate that viral replication factories could end up in the phloem and the xylem.

The mitochondria-targeted quinone SkQ1 prevented the destruction of EC nuclei induced by chitosan. Chitosan increased and SkQ1 suppressed the activity of protein kinases in N. benthamiana and P. sativum and eliminated the effect of chitosan. Chitosan induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the guard cells (GC) of pea plants. Treatment with chitosan or H2O2 did not cause destruction of GC nuclei; however, it resulted in disruption of the permeability barrier of the plasma membrane detected by propidium iodide fluorescence. Treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide but not peptidoglycan caused destruction of pea EC nuclei, which was prevented by SkQ1. Leaves of tobacco plants containing the N gene responsible for resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were infiltrated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells. These cells contained a genetic construct with the gene of the helicase domain of TMV replicase (p50); its protein product p50 is a target for the N-gene product. As a result, the hypersensitive response (HR) was initiated. The HR manifested itself in the death of leaves and was suppressed by SkQ3. Treatment of tobacco epidermal peels with the A. tumefaciens cells for the p50 gene expression stimulated the destruction of EC nuclei, which was inhibited by SkQ1 or SkQ3. The p50-lacking A. tumefaciens cells did not induce the destruction of EC nuclei. The protective effect of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants SkQ1 and SkQ3 demonstrates the involvement of mitochondria and their ROS in programmed cell death caused by pathogen elicitors.

Sensitive and robust procedures for the rapid detection of plant pathogens are therefore required to reduce yield losses and the use of expensive, environmentally damaging chemicals. Here we describe a simple and portable system for the rapid detection of viral pathogens in infected plants based on immunofiltration, subsequent magnetic detection, and the quantification of magnetically labeled virus particles. Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) was chosen as a model pathogen. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing the GFLV capsid protein were immobilized onto immunofiltration columns, and the same antibodies were linked to magnetic nanoparticles. GFLV was quantified by immunofiltration with magnetic labeling in a double-antibody sandwich configuration. A magnetic frequency mixing technique, in which a two-frequency magnetic excitation field was used to induce a sum frequency signal in the resonant detection coil, corresponding to the virus concentration within the immunofiltration column, was used for high-sensitivity quantification. We were able to measure GFLV concentrations in the range of 6 ng/ml to 20 Î¼g/ml in less than 30 min. The magnetic immunoassay could also be adapted to detect other plant viruses, including Potato virus X and Tobacco mosaic virus, with detection limits of 2 to 60 ng/ml.

The 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of the genomic RNA contain elements that enhance translation, and the 3'-UTR also contains the elements necessary for the initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis. Recent studies using a cell-free viral RNA translation-replication system revealed that a 70-nucleotide region containing a part of the 5'-UTR is bound cotranslationally by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) replication proteins translated from the genomic RNA and that the binding leads the genomic RNA to RNA replication pathway. This mechanism explains the cis-preferential replication of TMV by the replication proteins. The binding also inhibits further translation to avoid a fatal ribosome-RNA polymerase collision, which might arise if translation and negative-strand synthesis occur simultaneously on a single genomic RNA molecule.

This was achieved using a cassette composed of a full-length Arabidopsis thaliana transketolase cDNA under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The results revealed a major and unexpected effect of plastid transketolase overexpression as the transgenic tobacco plants exhibited a slow-growth phenotype and chlorotic phenotype. These phenotypes were complemented by germinating the seeds of transketolase-overexpressing lines in media containing either thiamine pyrophosphate or thiamine. Thiamine levels in the seeds and cotyledons were lower in transketolase-overexpressing lines than in wild-type plants. When transketolase-overexpressing plants were supplemented with thiamine or thiamine pyrophosphate throughout the life cycle, they grew normally and the seed produced from these plants generated plants that did not have a growth or chlorotic phenotype. Our results reveal the crucial importance of the level of transketolase activity to provide the precursor for synthesis of intermediates and to enable plants to produce thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate for growth and development. The mechanism determining transketolase protein levels remains to be elucidated, but the data presented provide evidence that this may contribute to the complex regulatory mechanisms maintaining thiamine homeostasis in plants.

The exposure of plants to elevated [CO2] revealed a lower incidence and severity of disease caused by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and by Pseudomonas syringae, whereas plant susceptibility to necrotrophic Botrytis cinerea increased. The elevated [CO2]-induced and basal resistance to TMV and P. syringae were completely abolished in plants in which the SA signalling pathway nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes 1 (NPR1) had been silenced or in transgenic plants defective in SA biosynthesis. In contrast, under both ambient and elevated [CO2], the susceptibility to B. cinerea highly increased in plants in which the JA signalling pathway proteinase inhibitors (PI) gene had been silenced or in a mutant affected in JA biosynthesis. However, plants affected in SA signalling remained less susceptible to this disease. These findings highlight the modulated antagonistic relationship between SA and JA that contributes to the variation in disease susceptibility under elevated [CO2]. This information will be critical for investigating how elevated CO2 may affect plant defence and the dynamics between plants and pathogens in both agricultural and natural ecosystems.

Materials in medicine,Study on nanocomposite construction based on the multi-functional biotemplate self-assembled by the recombinant TMGMV coat protein for potential biomedical applications.,10.1007/s10856-014-5326-x,"Nowadays there is a growing interest in bio-scaffolded nanoarchitectures. Rapid progress in nanobiotechnology and molecular biology has allowed the engineering of inorganic-binding peptides termed as genetically engineered polypeptides for inorganics (GEPIs) into self-assembling biological structures to facilitate the design of novel biomedical or bioimaging devices. Here we introduce a novel nanocomposite comprising a self-assembled protein scaffold based on a recombinant tobacco mild green mosaic tobamovirus (TMGMV) coat protein (CP) and the photocatalytic TiO2 nanoparticles attached to it, which may provide a generic method for materials engineering. A template containing a modified TMGMV CP (mCP) gene, with the first six C-terminal amino acid residues deleted to accommodate more foreign peptides and expressing a site-directed mutation of A123C for bioconjugation utility, and two genetically engineered mutants, Escherichia coli-based P-mCP-Ti7 containing a C-terminal TiO2 GEPI sequence of seven peptides (Ti7) and Hi5 insect cells-derived E-CP-Ti7-His6 C-terminally fused with Ti7+His6 tag were created. Expression vectors and protocols for enriching of the two CP variants were established and the resultant proteins were identified by western blot analysis. Their RNA-free self-assembling structures were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immuno-gold labeling TEM analysis. Adherence of nanoparticles to the P-mCP-Ti7 induced protein scaffold was visualized by TEM analysis. Also discussed is the Cysteine thiol reactivity in bioconjugation reactions with the maleimide-functionalized porphyrin photosensitizers which can function as clinical photodynamic therapy agents. This study introduced a novel approach to producing an assembly-competent recombinant TMGMV CP, examined its ability to serve as a novel platform for the multivalent display of surface ligands and demonstrated an alternative method for nanodevice synthesis for nanobiotechnological applications by combining GEPIs-mediated immobilization with the controllability of self-assembling recombinant TMGMV CP.

Recently, systemic necrosis has been suggested to have similar features to a defense response referred to as the hypersensitive response (HR), a form of programmed cell death. In virus-infected plant cells, host intracellular membrane structures are changed dramatically for more efficient viral replication. However, little is known about whether this replication-associated membrane modification is the cause of the symptoms. In this study, we identified an amino-terminal amphipathic helix of the helicase encoded by Radish mosaic virus (RaMV) (genus Comovirus) as an elicitor of cell death in RaMV-infected plants. Cell death caused by the amphipathic helix had features similar to HR, such as SGT1-dependence. Mutational analyses and inhibitor assays using cerulenin demonstrated that the amphipathic helix-induced cell death was tightly correlated with dramatic alterations in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane structures. Furthermore, the cell death-inducing activity of the amphipathic helix was conserved in Cowpea mosaic virus (genus Comovirus) and Tobacco ringspot virus (genus Nepovirus), both of which are classified in the family Secoviridae. Together, these results indicate that ER membrane modification associated with viral intracellular replication may be recognized to prime defense responses against plant viruses.

We expressed a chloroplast-targeted GGPS isolated from sunflower (Helianthus annuus) under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). The resulting transgenic tobacco plants expressing heterologous GGPS showed remarkably enhanced growth (an increase in shoot and root biomass and height), early flowering, increased number of seed pods and greater seed yield compared with that of GUS-transgenic lines (control) or wild-type plants. The gibberellin levels in HaGGPS-transgenic plants were higher than those in control plants, indicating that the observed phenotype may result from increased gibberellin content. However, in HaGGPS-transformant tobacco plants, we did not observe the phenotypic defects such as reduced chlorophyll content and greater petiole and stalk length, which were previously reported for transgenic plants expressing gibberellin biosynthetic genes. Fast plant growth was also observed in HaGGPS-expressing Arabidopsis and dandelion plants. The results of this study suggest that GGPS expression in crop plants may yield desirable agronomic traits, including enhanced growth of shoots and roots, early flowering, greater numbers of seed pods and/or higher seed yield.

The production of nanoscale anisotropic materials is a technical challenge. A unique biotemplating approach based on of rod-shaped nucleoprotein nanoparticles with predetermined aspect ratios (AR 3.5, 7, and 16.5) is used. These rigid, soft-matter nanoassemblies are derived from tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) components. The role of nanoparticle aspect ratio is investigated, while keeping the surface chemistries constant, using either PEGylated stealth nanoparticles or receptor-targeted RGD-displaying formulations. Aspect ratio has a profound impact on the behavior of the nanoparticles in vivo and in vitro. PEGylated nanorods with the lowest aspect ratio (AR 3.5) achieve the most efficient passive tumor-homing behavior because they can diffuse most easily, whereas RGD-labeled particles with a medium aspect ratio (AR 7) are more efficient at tumor targeting because this requires a balance between infusibility and ligand-receptor interactions. The in vivo behavior of nanoparticles can therefore be tailored to control biodistribution, longevity, and tumor penetration by modulating a single parameter: the aspect ratio of the nanocarrier.

Many nanomaterials including amorphous and crystal structures are synthesized via biomineralization in biological systems. Amongst various techniques, bionanotechnology is an effective strategy to manufacture a variety of sophisticated inorganic nanomaterials with precise control over their chemical composition, crystal structure, and shape by means of genetic engineering and natural bioassemblies. This provides opportunities to use renewable natural resources to develop high performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). For LIBs, reducing the sizes and dimensions of electrode materials can boost Li(+) ion and electron transfer in nanostructured electrodes. Recently, bionanotechnology has attracted great interest as a novel tool and approach, and a number of renewable biotemplate-based nanomaterials have been fabricated and used in LIBs. In this article, recent advances and mechanism studies in using bionanotechnology for high performance LIBs studies are thoroughly reviewed, covering two technical routes: (1) Designing and synthesizing composite cathodes, e.g. LiFePO4/C, Li3V2(PO4)3/C and LiMn2O4/C; and (2) designing and synthesizing composite anodes, e.g. NiO/C, Co3O4/C, MnO/C, Î±-Fe2O3 and nano-Si.

A novel function of Abutilon mosaic virus (AbMV) AC2 as a replication brake is described, utilizing transgenic plants with dimeric inserts of DNA B or with a reporter construct to express green fluorescent protein (GFP).

In addition, the effects were compared in the presence and in the absence of an unrelated tombusvirus suppressor of silencing (P19). The results show that AC2 suppresses replication reproducibly in all assays and that AC3 counteracts this effect. Examination of the topoisomer distribution of supercoiled DNA, which indicates changes in the viral minichromosome structure, did not support any influence of AC2 on transcriptional gene silencing and DNA methylation. The geminiviral AC2 protein has been detected here for the first time in plants. The experiments revealed an extremely low level of AC2, which was slightly increased if constructs with an intron and a hemagglutinin (HA) tag in addition to P19 expression were used.

The increasing popularity of plant production platforms is due to their lower cost, scalability, and lack of contaminating animal pathogens seen with other systems. Reports include production of complex VLPs consisting of 4 proteins expressed at finely-tuned expression levels, a prime-boost strategy for HIV vaccination using plant-made VLPs and a live viral vector, and the characterization and development of plant viral nanoparticles for use in cancer vaccines, drug delivery, and bioimaging.

We expand the picture of conservation and evolution of the 30K proteins, producing sequence alignment of the 30K superfamily with the broadest phylogenetic coverage thus far and illuminating structural features of the core all-beta fold of these proteins. Integrated copies of pararetrovirus 30K movement genes are prevalent in euphyllophytes, with at least one copy intact in nearly every examined species, and mRNAs detected for most of them. Sequence analysis suggests repeated integrations, pseudogenizations, and positive selection in those provirus genes. An unannotated 30K-superfamily gene in Arabidopsis thaliana genome is likely expressed as a fusion with the At1g37113 transcript.

Despite many decades of research, the origin of satRNAs remains unknown. In this study we show that a Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) transgene fused with a Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) Y satellite RNA (Y-Sat) sequence (35S-GUS:Sat) was transcriptionally repressed in N. tabacum in comparison to a 35S-GUS transgene that did not contain the Y-Sat sequence. This repression was not due to DNA methylation at the 35S promoter, but was associated with specific DNA methylation at the Y-Sat sequence. Both northern blot hybridization and small RNA deep sequencing detected 24-nt siRNAs in wild-type Nicotiana plants with sequence homology to Y-Sat, suggesting that the N. tabacum genome contains Y-Sat-like sequences that give rise to 24-nt sRNAs capable of guiding RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) to the Y-Sat sequence in the 35S-GUS:Sat transgene. Consistent with this, Southern blot hybridization detected multiple DNA bands in Nicotiana plants that had sequence homology to Y-Sat, suggesting that Y-Sat-like sequences exist in the Nicotiana genome as repetitive DNA, a DNA feature associated with 24-nt sRNAs. Our results point to a host genome origin for CMV satRNAs, and suggest novel approach of using small RNA sequences for finding the origin of other satRNAs.

1152,30699762,Plant disease,First Report of Potato mop top virus Causing Potato Tuber Necrosis in Colorado and New Mexico.,10.1094/PDIS-08-14-0819-PDN,"Potato mop top virus (PMTV) is considered the type member of the genus Pomovirus. PMTV is an important pathogen of potato vectored by the plasmodiophorid Spongospora subterranea f. sp. subterranea (Sss), which causes powdery scab of potato (1). Sss and PMTV are usually associated with cool and humid environments. PMTV-infected potato tubers generally exhibit internal hollow necrotic spots or concentric rings, and the virus is known to cause significant economic losses in Northern Europe, North and South America, and Asia (4). PMTV in the United States was first reported in Maine (2). Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) tubers cv. FL2048 and cv. Atlantic were sent to our laboratory from fields in Saguache County in Colorado and in San Juan County in New Mexico, respectively, during the spring of 2013. The tubers from both locations had multiple, internal, concentric, necrotic arcs and circles. Internal tissue with necrotic lesion from six symptomatic tubers from each location were crushed in liquid nitrogen followed by ribonucleic acid extraction using a Total RNA Isolation kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). These extracts were tested by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using three different sets of previously published primers for molecular detection of PMTV. The primer set H360/C819 targeting the coat protein (CP) on RNA 3 of PMTV yielded an amplicon (H360-CO and H360-NM) of 460 bp (4). The second set of primers, pmtF4/pmtR4 (5), amplified a 417-bp product (PMTF-CO and PMTF-NM) in RNA 2, and the third set, PMTV-P9/PMTV-M9 (3), designed to amplify the region encoding an 8-KD cysteine-rich protein in RNA 3 of PMTV, yielded a 507-bp amplicon (PMTV9-CO and PMTV9-NM). The amplicons generated from RT-PCR using all three sets were cloned (PGEMT-easy) and sequenced. Since the sequences from symptomatic tuber extracts from each location were identical to their respective primer sets, a consensus sequence from each primer set was submitted to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank. Sequences obtained from the H360/C819 primer set (GenBank Accession Nos. KM207013 and KM207014 for H360-CO and H360-NM, respectively) were 100% identical to the corresponding CP regions of PMTV isolates from North Dakota (HM776172). Sequences from the pmtF4/pmtR4 primer set (KM207015 and KM207016 for PMTF-CO and PMTF-NM, respectively) were 100% identical to the corresponding protein in RNA2 of PMTV isolates from North Dakota (GenBank HM776171), and sequences from the PMTV-P9/PMTV-M9 primer set (KM207017 and KM207018 for PMTV9-CO and PMTV9-NM respectively) were 99% identical to the corresponding protein in RNA3 of PMTV isolates (AY187010). The 100-99% homology of the sequences from this study to the corresponding PMTV sequences published in NCBI confirmed the occurrence of symptoms in the tubers from both Colorado and New Mexico due to PMTV. None of the symptomatic tubers tested positive for Tobacco rattle virus, Tomato spotted wilt virus, Alfalfa mosaic virus, Potato leafroll virus, or the necrotic strains of Potato virus Y by RT-PCR. To our knowledge, this is the first report of PMTV in potato in states of Colorado and New Mexico. References: (1) R. A. C. Jones and B. D. Harrsion. Ann. Appl. Biol. 63:1, 1969. (2) D. H.

1153,25541212,Bioconjugate chemistry,Interface of physics and biology: engineering virus-based nanoparticles for biophotonics.,10.1021/bc500524f,"Virus-based nanoparticles (VNPs) have been used for a wide range of applications, spanning basic materials science and translational medicine. Their propensity to self-assemble into precise structures that offer a three-dimensional scaffold for functionalization has led to their use as optical contrast agents and related biophotonics applications. A number of fluorescently labeled platforms have been developed and their utility in optical imaging demonstrated, yet their optical properties have not been investigated in detail. In this study, two VNPs of varying architectures were compared side-by-side to determine the impact of dye density, dye localization, conjugation chemistry, and microenvironment on the optical properties of the probes. Dyes were attached to icosahedral cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) and rod-shaped tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) through a range of chemistries to target particular side chains displayed at specific locations around the virus. The fluorescence intensity and lifetime of the particles were determined, first using photochemical experiments on the benchtop, and second in imaging experiments using tissue culture experiments. The virus-based optical probes were found to be extraordinarily robust under ultrashort, pulsed laser light conditions with a significant amount of excitation energy, maintaining structural and chemical stability. The most effective fluorescence output was achieved through dye placement at optimized densities coupled to the exterior surface avoiding conjugated ring systems. Lifetime measurements indicate that fluorescence output depends not only on spacing the fluorophores, but also on dimer stacking and configurational changes leading to radiationless relaxation-and these processes are related to the conjugation chemistry and nanoparticle shape. For biological applications, the particles were also examined in tissue culture, from which it was found that the optical properties differed from those found on the benchtop due to effects from cellular processes and uptake kinetics. Data indicate that fluorescent cargos are released in the endolysosomal compartment of the cell targeted by the virus-based optical probes. These studies provide insight into the optical properties and fates of fluorescent proteinaceous imaging probes. The cellular release of cargo has implications not only for virus-based optical probes, but also for drug delivery and release systems.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the frame-shift protein P3N-PIPO (for the protein encoded by the open reading frame [ORF] containing 5'-terminus of P3 and a +2 frame-shift ORF called Pretty Interesting Potyviridae ORF and embedded in the P3) and CYLINDRICAL INCLUSION (CI) proteins were required for potyvirus cell-to-cell movement. Here, we provide genetic evidence showing that a Tobacco vein banding mosaic virus (TVBMV; genus Potyvirus) mutant carrying a truncated PIPO domain of 58 amino acid residues could move between cells and induce systemic infection in Nicotiana benthamiana plants; mutants carrying a PIPO domain of seven, 20, or 43 amino acid residues failed to move between cells and cause systemic infection in this host plant. Interestingly, the movement-defective mutants produced progeny that eliminated the previously introduced stop codons and thus restored their systemic movement ability. We also present evidence showing that a developmentally regulated plasma membrane protein of N. benthamiana (referred to as NbDREPP) interacted with both P3N-PIPO and CI of the movement-competent TVBMV. The knockdown of NbDREPP gene expression in N. benthamiana impeded the cell-to-cell movement of TVBMV. NbDREPP was shown to colocalize with TVBMV P3N-PIPO and CI at plasmodesmata (PD) and traffic to PD via the early secretory pathway and the actomyosin motility system. We also show that myosin XI-2 is specially required for transporting NbDREPP to PD. In conclusion, NbDREPP is a key host protein within the early secretory pathway and the actomyosin motility system that interacts with two movement proteins and influences virus movement.

Brassica yellows virus (BrYV) is prevalently distributed throughout Mainland China and South Korea, is an important virus infecting cruciferous crops.

BrYV is an aphid-transmitted and phloem-limited virus. The use of infectious cDNA clones is an alternative means of infecting plants that allows reverse genetic studies to be performed. In this study, full-length cDNA clones of BrYV-A, recombinant BrYV5B3A, and BrYV-C were constructed under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. An agrobacterium-mediated inoculation system of Nicotiana benthamiana was developed using these cDNA clones. Three days after infiltration with full-length BrYV cDNA clones, necrotic symptoms were observed in the inoculated leaves of N. benthamiana; however, no obvious symptoms appeared in the upper leaves. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot detection of samples from the upper leaves showed that the maximum infection efficiency of BrYVs could reach 100%. The infectivity of the BrYV-A, BrYV-5B3A, and BrYV-C cDNA clones was further confirmed by northern hybridization.

In the past, the cross-protective viral variants were commonly derived from mild field isolates that were sometimes genetically heterogeneous, providing variable levels of cross-protection. Here, we report a novel approach to rapidly generate cross-protective variants of the tomato-infecting Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) independently of the availability of mild field isolates. Our approach sought to attenuate PepMV by mutating less conserved amino acid residues of the abundantly produced capsid protein (CP). These less-conserved amino acid residues were identified through multiple alignments of CPs of six potexviruses including PepMV, and were altered systematically to yield six PepMV mutants. These mutants were subsequently inoculated onto the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana, as well as tomato, to evaluate their accumulation levels, symptom severities, and cross-protection potentials.

1160,25482816,Plant signaling & behavior,Cucumber Mosaic Virus as a carotenoid inhibitor reducing Phelipanche aegyptiaca infection in tobacco plants.,10.4161/psb.32096,"Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV) is a highly infectious cucumovirus, which infects more than 800 plant species and causes major diseases in greenhouse and field crops worldwide. Parasitic weeds such as Phelipanche aegyptiaca are a major constraint to the production of many crops in the world and the parasite's lifestyle makes control extremely difficult. The parasite seeds can germinate after conditioning and perceiving strigolactones secreted by the host roots. Strigolactones are rhizosphere signaling molecules in plants that are biosynthesized through carotenoid cleavage. In the present study we investigated the possibility of reducing Î²-carotene and then strigolactone production in the host roots by blocking carotenoid biosynthesis using CMV-infected tobacco. It was found that CMV downregulated the enzyme phytoene desaturase(PDS) and reduced significantly both carotenoid production and Phelipanche infection in tobacco host roots infected with both CMV and P. aegyptiaca. Based on our results (decrease of Î²-carotene and repression of PDS transcripts in tobacco roots), we hypothesized that the reduction of Phelipanche tubercles and shoots occurred due to an effect of CMV on secondary metabolite stimulators such as strigolacetones. Our study indicated that mass production of the host roots was not affected by CMV; however, most inflorescences of Phelipanche grown on CMV-infected tobacco developed abnormally (deformed shoots and short nodes). Carotenoid biosynthesis inhibitors such as CMV can be used to reduce the production of strigolactones, which will lead to decreased Phelipanche attachment. Interestingly, attenuated CMV strains may provide a safe means for enhancing crop resistance against parasitic weeds in a future plan.

TAP-tag purification offers particular advantages for the identification of stimulus-induced protein interactions. Type II bZIP transcription factors (TGA2, TGA5 and TGA6) play key roles in pathways that control salicylic acid, ethylene, xenobiotic and reactive oxylipin signaling. Although proteins interacting with these transcription factors have been identified through genetic and yeast 2-hybrid screening, others are still elusive. We have therefore generated a C-terminal TAP-tag of TGA2 to isolate additional proteins that interact with this transcription factor. Three lines most highly expressing TAP-tagged TGA2 were functional in that they partially complemented reactive oxylipin-responsive gene expression in a tga2 tga5 tga6 triple mutant. TAP-tagged TGA2 in the most strongly overexpressing line was proteolytically less stable than in the other 2 lines. Only this overexpressing line could be used in a 2-step purification process, resulting in isolation of co-purifying bands of larger molecular weight than TGA2. TAP-tagged TGA2 was used to pull down NPR1, a protein known to interact with this transcription factor. Mass spectrometry was used to identify peptides that co-purified with TAP-tagged TGA2. Having generated this TGA2 TAP-tag line will therefore be an asset to researchers interested in stimulus-induced signal transduction processes.

Disruption of a putative long range RNA-RNA interacting structure between 5' and 3' untranslated regions of HLSV-22A and -24A resulted in reduced viral RNA and undetectable CP accumulation in inoculated leaves. Replacement of the IPAT in HLSV with an upstream pseudoknot domain (UPD) of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or insertion of the UPD to the immediate downstream of a 24 nt IPAT in HLSV resulted in drastically reduced viral RNA replication.

In this study, we demonstrated that the Oa-adapted FHV RNA1 transencapsidation process can take place in planta, by using a bipartite plant expression vector system, where TMV coat protein is expressed by another plant virus vector, Foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV). Dual infection in the same cell by both FHV and FoMV was observed. Though an apparent classical coat protein-mediated resistance repressed FHV expression, this was overcome by delaying inoculation of the TMV coat protein vector by 3 days after FHV vector inoculation.

Here we explored the use of enhanced expression of a modified bacterial atrazine chlorohydrolase, p-AtzA, in transgenic grasses (tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, and switchgrass) and the legume alfalfa for the biodegradation of atrazine. Enhanced expression of p-AtzA was obtained by using combinations of the badnavirus promoter, the maize alcohol dehydrogenase first intron, and the maize ubiquitin promoter. For alfalfa, we used the first intron of the 5'-untranslated region tobacco alcohol dehydrogenase gene and the cassava vein mosaic virus promoter. Resistance of plants to atrazine in agar-based and hydroponic growth assays was correlated with in vivo levels of gene expression and atrazine degradation.

Various studies have revealed that double-stranded transfer DNA (T-DNA) intermediates can serve as substrates by as yet uncharacterized integration machinery. Nevertheless, the possibility that T-strands are themselves substrates for integration cannot be ruled out. We attempted to block the conversion of T-strands into double-stranded intermediates prior to integration in order to further investigate the route taken by T-DNA molecules on their way to integration. Transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants that overexpress three yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) protein subunits of DNA REPLICATION FACTOR A (RFA) were produced. In yeast, these subunits (RFA1-RFA3) function as a complex that can bind single-stranded DNA molecules, promoting the repair of genomic double strand breaks. Overexpression of the RFA complex in tobacco resulted in decreased T-DNA expression, as determined by infection with A. tumefaciens cells carrying the Î²-glucuronidase intron reporter gene. Gene expression was not blocked when the reporter gene was delivered by microbombardment. Enhanced green fluorescent protein-assisted localization studies indicated that the three-protein complex was predominantly nuclear, thus indicating its function within the plant cell nucleus, possibly by binding naked T-strands and blocking their conversion into double-stranded intermediates. This notion was further supported by the inhibitory effect of RFA expression on the cell-to-cell movement of Bean dwarf mosaic virus, a single-stranded DNA virus. The observation that RFA complex plants dramatically inhibited the transient expression level of T-DNA and only reduced T-DNA integration by 50% suggests that double-stranded T-DNA intermediates, as well as single-stranded T-DNA, play significant roles in the integration process.

Thought to be exclusive to animals, synaptotagmins have recently been characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which they comprise a five gene family. Using infectivity and leaf-based functional assays, we have shown that Arabidopsis SYTA regulates endocytosis and marks an endosomal vesicle recycling pathway to regulate movement protein-mediated trafficking of the Begomovirus Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV) and the Tobamovirus Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) through plasmodesmata (Lewis and Lazarowitz, 2010). To determine whether SYTA has a central role in regulating the cell-to-cell trafficking of a wider range of diverse plant viruses, we extended our studies here to examine the role of SYTA in the cell-to-cell movement of additional plant viruses that employ different modes of movement, namely the Potyvirus Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), the Caulimovirus Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and the Tobamovirus Turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV), which in contrast to TMV does efficiently infect Arabidopsis. We found that both TuMV and TVCV systemic infection, and the cell-to-cell trafficking of the their movement proteins, were delayed in the Arabidopsis Col-0 syta-1 knockdown mutant. In contrast, CaMV systemic infection was not inhibited in syta-1. Our studies show that SYTA is a key regulator of plant virus intercellular movement, being necessary for the ability of diverse cell-to-cell movement proteins encoded by Begomoviruses (CaLCuV MP), Tobamoviruses (TVCV and TMV 30K protein) and Potyviruses (TuMV P3N-PIPO) to alter PD and thereby mediate virus cell-to-cell spread.

We found that these cortical punctate structures constitute a viral replication complex (VRC) in addition to the previously reported aggregate structures that formed adjacent to the nucleus. We identified host proteins that interacted with RCNMV MP in virus-infected Nicotiana benthamiana leaves using a tandem affinity purification method followed by mass spectrometry. One of these host proteins was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase-A (NbGAPDH-A), which is a component of the Calvin-Benson cycle in chloroplasts. Virus-induced gene silencing of NbGAPDH-A reduced RCNMV multiplication in the inoculated leaves, but not in the single cells, thereby suggesting that GAPDH-A plays a positive role in cell-to-cell movement of RCNMV. The fusion protein of NbGAPDH-A and green fluorescent protein localized exclusively to the chloroplasts. In the presence of RCNMV RNA1, however, the protein localized to the cortical VRC as well as the chloroplasts. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay and GST pulldown assay confirmed in vivo and in vitro interactions, respectively, between the MP and NbGAPDH-A. Furthermore, gene silencing of NbGAPDH-A inhibited MP localization to the cortical VRC. We discuss the possible roles of NbGAPDH-A in the RCNMV movement process.

However, only a small number of the viruses that can potentially infect soybean are considered as major economic problems to soybean production. Therefore, we consider management options available to control diseases caused by eight viruses that cause, or have the potential to cause, significant economic loss to producers. We summarize management tactics in use and suggest direction for the future. Clearly, the most important tactic is disease resistance. Several resistance genes are available for three of the eight viruses discussed. Other options include use of virus-free seed and avoidance of alternative virus hosts when planting. Attempts at arthropod vector control have generally not provided consistent disease management. In the future, disease management will be considerably enhanced by knowledge of the interaction between soybean and viral proteins. Identification of genes required for soybean defense may represent key regulatory hubs that will enhance or broaden the spectrum of basal resistance to viruses.

Several begomoviruses were reported from different parts of the country; however, identity of begomovirus associated with leaf curl disease in tomato in north-eastern states of India was obscured. In the present study, the complete genome of an isolate (To-Ag-1) of begomovirus was generated from a leaf curl sample collected from Tripura state. However, no DNA-B and betasatellite were detected in the field samples. The genome of To-Ag-1 isolate contained 2,755 nucleotides that shared 94.7 % sequence identity with Tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV) and 71.3-90.1 % sequence identity with the other tomato-infecting begomoviruses occurring in the Indian subcontinent. Several inter-specific recombination events among different tomato-infecting begomoviruses from India and intra-specific recombination among different isolates of TbCSV reported from China were observed in the genome of To-Ag-1 isolate. Agroinoculation of the virus alone produced leaf curl symptoms in tomato and Nicotiana benthamiana. However, co-inoculation with a non-cognate betasatellite, Croton yellow vein mosaic betasatellite (CroYVMB) with the TbCSV resulted in increased severity of the symptoms both in tomato and N. benthamiana. Systemic distribution of the TbCSV and CroYVMB was detected in the newly developed leaves of tobacco and tomato, which showed ability of TbCSV to trans-replicate CroYVMB. The present study for the first time provides evidence of occurrence of TbCSV in tomato in north-eastern region of India and showed increased virulence of TbCSV with a non-cognate betasatellite.",eng,2014,11,20,2014,11,21,ppublish,"Begomovirus|DNA Replication|DNA, Satellite|DNA, Viral|India|Lycopersicon esculentum|Molecular Sequence Data|Phylogeny|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Recombination, Genetic|Sequence Analysis, DNA|Sequence Homology|Tobacco",D053839|D004261|D004276|D004279|D007194|D018551|D008969|D010802|D010935|D018515|D011995|D017422|D017385|D014026,
1176,25408506,Planta,The relationship between the plant-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1 and alternative oxidase in tomato basal defense against Tobacco mosaic virus.,10.1007/s00425-014-2207-y,"Salicylic acid (SA) plays a critical role in plant defense against pathogen attack. The SA-induced viral defense in plants is distinct from the pathways mediating bacterial and fungal defense, which is pathogenesis-related protein-independent but involves an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 1 (RDR1)-mediated RNA silencing mechanism and/or an alternative oxidase (AOX)-associated defense pathway. However, the relationship between these two viral defense-related pathways remains unclear. In this study, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) inoculation onto Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) leaves induced a rapid induction of the SlAOX1a transcript level as well as the total and CN-resistant respiration at 0.5Â dpi, followed by an increase in SlRDR1 gene expression at 1Â dpi in the upper uninoculated leaves. Silencing SlRDR1 using virus-induced gene silencing system significantly reduced SlRDR1 expression and tomato defense against TMV but had no evident effect on SlAOX1a transcription. Conversely, silencing SlAOX1a not only effectively reduced the AOX1a transcript level, but also blocked the TMV-induced SlRDR1 expression and decreased the basal defense against TMV. Furthermore, the application of an exogenous AOX activator on empty vector-silenced control plants greatly induced the accumulation of SlRDR1 and SlAOX1a transcript and reduced TMV viral RNA accumulation, but failed to have such effects on SlRDR1-silenced plants. Moreover, RDR1-overexpressed transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants enhanced defense against TMV than the empty vector-transformed plants, but these effects were not affected by the exogenous AOX activator or inhibitor. These results indicate that RDR1 is involved in the AOX-mediated defense pathway against TMV infection and plays a crucial role in enhancing RNA silencing to limit virus systemic spread.

A largely simultaneous initiation at two origins and subsequent bidirectional tube elongation could be visualized by transmission electron microscopy of intermediates and final products. Collision of the nascent tubes' ends produced angular particles with well-defined arm lengths. RNAs with three to five OAs generated branched multipods with a maximum of four arms.

It is involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), redox signaling, the modulation of defense gene expression, and the regulation of enzymatic activities. Even though changes in glutathione contents are well documented in plants and its roles in plant defense are well established, still too little is known about its compartment-specific importance during abiotic and biotic stress conditions. Due to technical advances in the visualization of glutathione and the redox state through microscopical methods some progress was made in the last few years in studying the importance of subcellular glutathione contents during stress conditions in plants. This review summarizes the data available on compartment-specific importance of glutathione in the protection against abiotic and biotic stress conditions such as high light stress, exposure to cadmium, drought, and pathogen attack (Pseudomonas, Botrytis, tobacco mosaic virus). The data will be discussed in connection with the subcellular accumulation of ROS during these conditions and glutathione synthesis which are both highly compartment specific (e.g., glutathione synthesis takes place in chloroplasts and the cytosol). Thus this review will reveal the compartment-specific importance of glutathione during abiotic and biotic stress conditions.

SA-induced viral defense in plants is distinct from the pathways mediating bacterial and fungal defense and involves a specific pathway mediated by mitochondria; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The SA-binding activity of the recombinant tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (SlÎ±-kGDH) E2 subunit of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was characterized. The biological role of this binding in plant defenses against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was further investigated via SlÎ±-kGDH E2 silencing and transient overexpression in plants. SlÎ±-kGDH E2 was found to bind SA in two independent assays. SA treatment, as well as SlÎ±-kGDH E2 silencing, increased resistance to TMV. SA did not further enhance TMV defense in SlÎ±-kGDH E2-silenced tomato plants but did reduce TMV susceptibility in Nicotiana benthamiana plants transiently overexpressing SlÎ±-kGDH E2. Furthermore, SlÎ±-kGDH E2-silencing-induced TMV resistance was fully blocked by bongkrekic acid application and alternative oxidase 1a silencing. These results indicated that binding by SlÎ±-kGDH E2 of SA acts upstream of and affects the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which plays an important role in basal defense against TMV. The findings of this study help to elucidate the mechanisms of SA-induced viral defense.

By the 1890s, however, some disease-causing agents were found to pass through filters that retained the common bacteria. Such an agent was called ""filterable virus,"" the best known being the virus that caused tobacco mosaic disease. By the 1920s there were many examples of filterable viruses, but no clear understanding of their nature. However, by the 1930s, the term ""filterable virus"" was being abandoned in favor of simply ""virus,"" meaning an agent other than bacteria. Visualization of viruses by the electron microscope in the late 1930s finally settled their particulate nature. This article describes the ever-changing concept of ""virus"" and how virologists talked about viruses.

In the present work, viruses and viroids infecting chrysanthemum were investigated in China in 2012 and 2013. Typical viral symptoms were observed in field-grown chrysanthemum with leaf yellowing and mottled leaves in Wenjiang District, Sichuan Province, China. The incidence of these symptoms in the field was 12.3%.

In June 2012, typical mosaic symptoms were observed on many A. rugosa plants in a field in Shanxi Province. The incidence of this disease reached more than 60% in a 2.6-ha field. Seven symptomatic plants were tested by DAS-ELISA using monoclonal antibodies specific for Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV); all antisera used in DAS-ELISA were generated and validated in our laboratory. CMV was found in all seven samples tested, but not TMV and ToMV. Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) extracted from infected leaves were used as templates in the subsequent two-step RT-PCR reaction (1). In order to further confirm the presence of CMV, a pair of specific primers (forward: 5'-ACGTCGACCATGGACAAATC-3', and reverse: 5'-TACCCGGGTCAGACTGGTAGCACC-3') based on the coat protein gene sequence of CMV were used to amplify PCR products of the expected size (657 bp) from ELISA-positive samples (2).

Comparison between the CP genomic sequences of the two viruses, showed a relatively low variability, 0.199, and a maximum nucleotide distance between isolates of 0.411. Analysis of comparative models of OMMV and TNV-D CPs, showed that naturally occurring substitutions in their respective sequences do not seem to cause significant alterations in the virion structure. This is consistent with a high selective pressure to preserve the structure of viral capsid proteins.

However, depending on the strategy followed to achieve PTGS of the transgene, different responses to external conditions can be expected. In the present study, we utilized the Nicotiana benthamianaâPlum pox virus (PPV) pathosystem to evaluate in detail the stability of intron-hairpin(ihp)-mediated virus resistance under conditions known to adversely affect PTGS. The ihp plants grown at low or high temperatures were fully resistant to multiple PPV challenges, different PPV inoculum concentrations and even to a PPV isolate differing from the ihp construct by more than 28% at the nucleotide level. In addition, infections of ihp plants with viruses belonging to Cucumovirus, Potyvirus or Tombusvirus, all known to affect PTGS at different steps, were not able to defeat PPV resistance. Low temperatures did not affect the accumulation of transgenic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), whereas a clear increase in the amount of siRNAs was observed during infections sustained by Cucumber mosaic virus and Potato virus Y. Our results show that the above stress factors do not represent an important concern for the production,through ihp-PTGS technology, of transgenic plants having robust virus resistance traits.",eng,,,,2014,10,28,ppublish,"Disease Resistance|Plant Diseases|Plants, Genetically Modified|Plum Pox Virus|RNA Interference|RNA, Small Interfering|Stress, Physiological|Tobacco|Transgenes",D060467|D010935|D030821|D017801|D034622|D034741|D013312|D014026|D019076,

Although myosin motors are thought to contribute to plant virus infection, their exact roles in the specific infection steps have not been addressed. Here we investigated the replication, cell-to-cell and systemic spread of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) using dominant negative inhibition of myosin activity. We found that interference with the functions of three class VIII myosins and two class XI myosins significantly reduced the local and long-distance transport of the virus. We further determined that the inactivation of myosins XI-2 and XI-K affected the structure and dynamic behavior of the ER leading to aggregation of the viral movement protein (MP) and to a delay in the MP accumulation in plasmodesmata (PD). The inactivation of myosin XI-2 but not of myosin XI-K affected the localization pattern of the 126k replicase subunit and the level of TMV accumulation. The inhibition of myosins VIII-1, VIII-2 and VIII-B abolished MP localization to PD and caused its retention at the plasma membrane. These results suggest that class XI myosins contribute to the viral propagation and intracellular trafficking, whereas myosins VIII are specifically required for the MP targeting to and virus movement through the PD. Thus, TMV appears to recruit distinct myosins for different steps in the cell-to-cell spread of the infection.

This work discusses different approaches to predicting encapsidated viral RNA and highlights satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) RNA as a model system with excellent crystallography data. Fundamentally important issues for debate include thermodynamic versus kinetic control of virus assembly and the possible consequences of quasi-species in the primary structure on RNA secondary structure prediction of a single structure or an ensemble of structures. Multiple computational tools and chemical reagents are now available for improved viral RNA structure prediction. Two different predicted structures for encapsidated STMV RNA result from differences in three main areas: a different approach and philosophy to studying encapsidated viral RNA, an emphasis on different RNA motifs, and technical differences in computational methods and chemical reagents. The experiments with traditional chemical probing and SHAPE reagents are compared in terms of chemistry, results, and interpretation for STMV RNA as well as other RNA protein assemblies, such as the 5'UTR of HIV and the ribosome. This discussion of the challenges of viral RNA structure prediction will lead to new experiments and improved future predictions for viral RNA.

In this study, we analyzed the localization and motility of the nucleocapsid protein (NP) of Fig mosaic virus (FMV), a negative-strand RNA virus belonging to the recently established genus Emaravirus. Electron microscopy of FMV-infected cells using immunogold labeling showed that NPs formed cytoplasmic agglomerates that were predominantly enveloped by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, while nonenveloped NP agglomerates also localized along the ER. Likewise, transiently expressed NPs formed agglomerates, designated NP bodies (NBs), in close proximity to the ER, as was the case in FMV-infected cells. Subcellular fractionation and electron microscopic analyses of NP-expressing cells revealed that NBs localized in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we found that NBs moved rapidly with the streaming of the ER in an actomyosin-dependent manner. Brefeldin A treatment at a high concentration to disturb the ER network configuration induced aberrant accumulation of NBs in the perinuclear region, indicating that the ER network configuration is related to NB localization. Dominant negative inhibition of the class XI myosins, XI-1, XI-2, and XI-K, affected both ER streaming and NB movement in a similar pattern. Taken together, these results showed that NBs localize in the cytoplasm but in close proximity to the ER membrane to form enveloped particles and that this causes passive movements of cytoplasmic NBs by ER streaming.",eng,2014,10,15,2014,10,17,ppublish,"Cytoplasm|Endoplasmic Reticulum|Ficus|Microscopy, Immunoelectron|Nucleocapsid Proteins|Plant Viruses|Protein Multimerization|Protein Transport|RNA Viruses|Tobacco",D003593|D004721|D030681|D016253|D019590|D010942|D055503|D021381|D012328|D014026,

We have utilized TMV self-assembly characteristics to create a novel Flock House virus (FHV) RNA nanoparticle. FHV encodes a viral polymerase supporting autonomous replication of the FHV genome, which makes it an attractive candidate for viral transgene expression studies and targeted RNA delivery into host cells. However, FHV viral genome size is strictly limited by native FHV capsid. To determine if this packaging restriction could be eliminated, FHV was adapted to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), to allow for monitoring of functional FHV RNA activity. Then TMV OA was introduced in six 3' insertion sites, with only site one supporting functional FHV GFP expression. To create nanoparticles, FHV GFP-OA modified genomic RNA was mixed in vitro with TMV coat protein and monitored for encapsidation by agarose electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The production of TMV-like rod shaped nanoparticles indicated that modified FHV RNA can be encapsidated by purified TMV coat protein by self-assembly. This is the first demonstration of replication-independent packaging of the FHV genome by protein self-assembly.

Analysis using the complete CP amino acid sequence showed one clade with two subgroups, IA and IB, with Iranian isolates in both subgroups. The nucleotide diversity within each sub-group was very low, but higher between the two clades. No correlation was found between genetic distance and geographical origin or host species of isolation.

In August 2013, foliar mottle, shrinking, and necrosis were observed on pepper plants in several vegetable greenhouses of Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region, China. Seven symptomatic samples were collected and tested by dot-blot ELISA with antisera against Cucumber mosaic virus, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus, Tomato spotted wilt virus, Turnip mosaic virus, and Broad bean wilt virus 2 (kindly provided by Dr. Xueping Zhou of Zhejiang University, China) (3). One of the bell pepper (Capsicum annuum var. grossum) samples reacted with the TMV antibody. Rod-shaped virus particles 300 nm in length were observed in this sample under electron microscopy. The results suggested that a tobamovirus closely related to TMV might be a causal agent. Total nucleic acids were then extracted from all seven samples using a CTAB method (1) and tested by RT-PCR using a pair of tobamovirus degenerate primers, TobamoF (GCWAAGGTKGTWYTBGTRGAYGG) and TobamoR (GTAATTGCTATTGDGTWCCWGC).

It is extensively used in grass-legume pastures, but also has the potential to invade agricultural lands and natural ecosystems. White clover is a well-known natural host for Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV), Soybean dwarf virus (SbDV), Beet western virus (BWYV), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), etc (1). In July 2013, during a survey to determine the presence of different viruses infecting weed plants in South Korea, three white clover leaf samples showing yellow mosaic symptoms were collected from Taean County, South Chungcheong Do Province, South Korea. In order to identify the infecting virus, total RNA from three leaf samples was extracted using the Tri-reagent (MRC Reagent, Inc., OH) as described by the manufacturer, and was applied to the large-scale oligonucleotide (LSON) chip (3), wherein probes specific to a ClYVV isolate produced a positive reaction. All three samples tested were positive for ClYVV. To confirm this result, ClYVV-specific primers were designed using the sequences of four ClYVV isolates from NCBI (GenBank Accession Nos. AF185959, AF203536, DQ333346, and NC003536). Total RNA was extracted from symptomatic white clover samples using Easy-Spin Total RNA Extraction Kit (iNtRon, Daejeon, Korea) and used as template for RT-PCR. The positive control RNA was used from ClYVV GM isolate (KF975894) and negative control RNA used symptomless white clover plants. The ClYVV coat protein (CP) gene was amplified by RT-PCR using the specific primer pairs ClYVV-CP-F / ClYVV-CP-R (5'-CAAGAGCAGCACGATGAG-3' and 5'-CTCGCTCTATAAAGATCAGAT-3'). DNA fragments of the expected size (1,042 bp) were obtained from the white clover Korea isolate (AB930132), and the PCR product was cloned into a T&A cloning vector (RBC Bioscience, Taipei, Taiwan) and sequenced directly in both directions. BLAST analyses of the nucleotide sequence CP gene fragments revealed the highest identity with 98% with other ClYVV isolates (AF203536). To determine the experimental host range of the ClYVV Korea isolate, we inoculated five species (Chenopodium amaranticolor, C. quinoa, Nicotiana clevelandii, N. benthamiana, and Trifolium repens) in three families using this isolate. All test plants were mechanically inoculated with 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (Takara, Tokyo, Japan). Each test plant was inoculated nine times and grown in a greenhouse maintained at 27 to 33Â°C. Necrotic local lesions were produced on inoculated leaves of C. amaranticolor, C. quinoa, and N. clevelandii 4 to 6 days post-inoculation. After 10 to 14 days, C. amaranticolor and C. quinoa showed systemic chlorotic spot symptoms, and N. clevelandii, N. benthamiana, and T. repens showed chlorotic spot, mild mosaic, and mosaic in the upper leaves, respectively. Up to now, in South Korea, ClYVV has been detected in gladiolus (Gladiolus gandavensis) (3) and soybean (Glycine max) (4). ClYVV can be easily transmitted by insect, aphid, or mechanical inoculation and has a host range including tobacco, soybean, etc. The presence of ClYVV could become an important threat to crop production in South Korea. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a ClYVV infection of the white clover plant in South Korea. References: (1) B. L. Denny and P. L. Guy. Australas. Plant Pathol. 38:270, 2009. (2) M.

Mol Plant Microbe Interact, 20: 1489-1494). Through their young stages these plants exhibit strong resistance against both the endogenously expressed and exogenously inoculated TMV, but at the age of about 7-8 weeks they break into TMV infection, with typical severe virus symptoms. Infections with some other viruses (Potato viruses Y, A, and X) induce the breaking of the TMV resistance and lead to synergistic proliferation of both viruses. To deduce the gene functions related to this early resistance, we have performed microarray analysis of the transgenic plants during the early resistant stage, and after the resistance break, and also of TMV-infected wild type tobacco plants. Comparison of these transcriptomes to those of corresponding wild type healthy plants indicated that 1362, 1150 and 550 transcripts were up-regulated in the transgenic plants before and after the resistance break, and in the TMV-infected wild type tobacco plants, respectively, and 1422, 1200 and 480 transcripts were down-regulated in these plants, respectively. These transcriptome alterations were distinctly different between the three types of plants, and it appears that several different mechanisms, such as the enhanced expression of the defense, hormone signaling and protein degradation pathways contributed to the TMV-resistance in the young transgenic plants. In addition to these alterations, we also observed a distinct and unique gene expression alteration in these plants, which was the strong suppression of the translational machinery. This may also contribute to the resistance by slowing down the synthesis of viral proteins. Viral replication potential may also be suppressed, to some extent, by the reduction of the translation initiation and elongation factors eIF-3 and eEF1A and B, which are required for the TMV replication complex.

Moreover, recent evidence indicates that ectopically expressed P6 inclusion-like bodies (I-LBs) move in association with actin microfilaments. Because CaMV virions accumulate preferentially in P6 IBs, we hypothesized that P6 IBs have a role in delivering CaMV virions to the plasmodesmata. We have determined that the P6 protein interacts with a C2 calcium-dependent membrane-targeting protein (designated Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana] Soybean Response to Cold [AtSRC2.2]) in a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid screen and have confirmed this interaction through coimmunoprecipitation and colocalization assays in the CaMV host Nicotiana benthamiana. An AtSRC2.2 protein fused to red fluorescent protein (RFP) was localized to the plasma membrane and specifically associated with plasmodesmata. The AtSRC2.2-RFP fusion also colocalized with two proteins previously shown to associate with plasmodesmata: the host protein Plasmodesmata-Localized Protein1 (PDLP1) and the CaMV movement protein (MP). Because P6 I-LBs colocalized with AtSRC2.2 and the P6 protein had previously been shown to interact with CaMV MP, we investigated whether P6 I-LBs might also be associated with plasmodesmata. We examined the colocalization of P6-RFP I-LBs with PDLP1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and aniline blue (a stain for callose normally observed at plasmodesmata) and found that P6-RFP I-LBs were associated with each of these markers. Furthermore, P6-RFP coimmunoprecipitated with PDLP1-GFP. Our evidence that a portion of P6-GFP I-LBs associate with AtSRC2.2 and PDLP1 at plasmodesmata supports a model in which P6 IBs function to transfer CaMV virions directly to MP at the plasmodesmata.

1209,25220764,Molecular plant pathology,Light intensity and temperature affect systemic spread of silencing signal in transient agroinfiltration studies.,10.1111/mpp.12205,"RNA silencing is a sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene inactivation mechanism that operates in diverse organisms and that can extend beyond its site of initiation, owing to the movement of the silencing signal, called non-autonomous gene silencing. Previous studies have shown that several factors manifest the movement of the silencing signal, such as the size (21 or 24 nucleotides) of the secondary small interfering RNA (siRNA) produced, the steady-state concentration of siRNAs and their cognate messenger RNA (mRNA) or a change in the sink-source status of plant parts affecting phloem translocation. Our study shows that both light intensity and temperature have a significant impact on the systemic movement of the silencing signal in transient agroinfiltration studies in Nicotiana benthamiana. At higher light intensities (â¥ 450 Î¼E/m(2)/s) and higher temperatures (â¥ 30 Â°C), gene silencing was localized to leaf tissue that was infiltrated, without any systemic spread. Interestingly, in these light and temperature conditions (â¥ 450 Î¼E/m(2) /s and â¥ 30 Â°C), the N.âbenthamiana plants showed recovery from the viral symptoms. However, the reduced systemic silencing and reduced viral symptom severity at higher light intensities were caused by a change in the sink-source status of the plant, ultimately affecting the phloem translocation of small RNAs or the viral genome. In contrast, at lower light intensities (<300 Î¼E/m(2)/s) with a constant temperature of 25 Â°C, there was strong systemic movement of the silencing signal in the N. benthamiana plants and reduced recovery from virus infections. The accumulation of gene-specific siRNAs was reduced at higher temperature as a result of a reduction in the accumulation of transcript on transient agroinfiltration of RNA interference (RNAi) constructs, mostly because of poor T-DNA transfer activity of Agrobacterium, possibly also accompanied by reduced phloem translocation.",eng,2014,10,27,2014,9,16,ppublish,"Agrobacterium|DNA, Bacterial|DNA, Viral|Gene Silencing|Gene Transfer Techniques|Green Fluorescent Proteins|Humidity|Light|Mosaic Viruses|Phenotype|Phloem|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plants, Genetically Modified|RNA, Small Interfering|Temperature|Tobacco|Transgenes",D060054|D004269|D004279|D020868|D018014|D049452|D006813|D008027|D009029|D010641|D052585|D010935|D018515|D030821|D034741|D013696|D014026|D019076,light intensity|phloem translocation|symptom recovery|systemic silencing|temperature|virus

1215,30699655,Plant disease,First Report of Tomato spotted wilt virus in Brugmansia suaveolens in Korea.,10.1094/PDIS-02-14-0173-PDN,"Brugmansia suaveolens, also known as angel's trumpet, is a semi-woody shrub or a small tree. Because flowers of B. suaveolens are remarkably beautiful and sweetly fragrant, B. suaveolens is grown as ornamentals outdoors year-round in the tropics and subtropics, and as potted plants in temperate regions (1). In February 2013, virus-like symptoms including mosaic symptoms followed by distortion of leaves were observed in a potted B. suaveolens in a nursery in Chung-Nam Province, Korea. Symptomatic leaves were analyzed for the presence of several ornamental viruses including Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Tomato bush stunt virus (TBSV), and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) by immune-strip diagnostic kits that were developed by our laboratory. Positive controls and extract from healthy leaves of B. suaveolens as a negative control were included in each immune-strip assay. TSWV was detected serologically from the naturally infected B. suaveolens, but CMV, TBSV, and TMV were not detected from the B. suaveolens. The presence of TSWV (named TSWV-AT1) was confirmed by commercially available double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA kits (Agdia, Elkhart, IN). TSWV-AT1 was mechanically transmitted from the ELISA-positive B. suaveolens to Capsicum annuum and Nicotiana glutinosa, respectively. Inoculated C. annuum showed chlorotic rings in the inoculated leaves and inoculated N. glutinosa produced mosaic and systemic necrosis in the inoculated leaves after 7 days inoculation, respectively, which were consistent with symptoms caused by TSWV (2). To confirm further TSWV-AT1 infection, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed using the One-Step RT-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with TSWV-specific primers, TSWV-NCP-For and TSWV-NCP-Rev (3), designed to amplify a 777-bp cDNA of the nucleocapsid protein (NCP) gene. Total RNAs from naturally infected B. suaveolens, symptomatic C. annuum, and N. glutinosa were extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNAs obtained from a Korean isolate of TSWV (Accession No. JF730744) and healthy B. suaveolens were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The expected size of the RT-PCR product was amplified from symptomatic B. suaveolens, C. annuum, and N. glutinosa but not from healthy leaves of B. suaveolens. The amplified RT-PCR product from TSWV-AT1 was directly sequenced using BigDye Termination kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Multiple alignment of the TSWV-AT1 NCP sequence (AB910533) with NCP sequences of other TSWV isolates using MEGA5 software (4) revealed 99.0% aa identity with an Korean TSWV isolate (AEB33895) originating from tomato. These results provide additional confirmation of TSWV-AT1 infection. It is known that high-value ornamentals may act also as reservoirs for TSWV that can infect other ornamentals and cultivated crops, because TSWV has a very broad host range (2). Elaborate inspections for TSWV and other viruses are necessary for production of healthy B. suaveolens, since the popularity and economic importance of this ornamental plant is increasing.

In Korea, eight viruses have been reported to infect soybean, including Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Soybean dwarf virus (SbDV), Soybean mosaic virus (SMV), Soybean yellow common mosaic virus (SYCMV), Soybean yellow mottle virus (SYMMV), and Peanut stunt virus (PSV) (1). In 2012, Glycine max were observed in Daegu, South Korea, with mosaic and mottling symptoms on leaves. Samples with virus-like symptoms (n = 151) were collected from Daegu including legume genetic resource field. Virus particles were filamentous rod shaped, average length 760 nm, and were analyzed by RT-PCR using specific primers for several Potyviruses and previously reported viruses infecting soybean. Only two samples showing mosaic and mottling symptoms were identified as Clover yellow vein virus (ClYVV) based on RT-PCR using primers specific for ClYVV (5'-GTTGGCTTGGTTGACACTGA-3' and 5'-CTTCGATCATGGATGCACA-3'). The sequences of amplified fragments were 97 to 98% similar with ClYVV. ClYVV is a distinct species in the genus Potyvirus and family Potyviridae. ClYVV is transmitted by several species of aphids and by mechanical inoculation (2). ClYVV was first reported on Gentiana scabra, and the disease has never been reported in soybean fields in Korea. The biological properties and full genome sequence of the selected ClYVV isolate of apparent virus symptoms between two samples were analyzed. The ClYVV isolate was inoculated to local lesion plants, re-isolated from local lesions three times, and propagated in Nicotiana benthamiana, and then named ClYVV-Gm. The ClYVV-Gm induced local lesions on inoculated leaves of N. tabacum cv. Xanthi-nc, Tetragonia expansa, and systemic symptoms on upper leaves of Chenopodium amaranticolor, C. quinoa, and N. clevelandii. The ClYVV-Gm caused mosaic and mottling symptoms on Glycine max cv. Kwangan and Phaseolus vulgaris. The genome of ClYVV-Gm was determined to be 9,584 nucleotides in length (GenBank Accession No. KF975894), and it shared 83% to 97% nucleotide identity with the sequences of 27 previously reported ClYVV isolates including Vicia fava and Pisum sativum. Despite low occurrence of ClYVV in Glycine max, ClYVV has a broad host range including tobacco, weed species, and soybean, which can lead to spreading of the virus.

However, sequence redundancy due to promoter duplication often leads to genetic instability. Although heterologous subgenomic promoter-like sequences (SGPs) have been successfully used in Tobacco mosaic virus vectors, only homologous SGP duplications have been used in PVX vectors. We stabilized PVX-based vectors by combining heterologous SGPs from related potexviruses with an N-terminal coat protein (CP) deletion. We selected two SGPs with core sequences homologous to PVX, from Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) and Cassava common mosaic virus, as well as a SGP with a heterologous core sequence from Foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV). We found that only the BaMV and CsCMV SGPs were utilized by the PVX replicase. However, the transgene remained unstable, due to the presence of an additional region with strong sequence similarity at the 5' end of the cp gene. The BaMV SGP combined with an N-terminal CP deletion achieved high PVX vector stability. This new expression vector is particularly useful for long-term production of proteins and for larger inserts. The improved PVX-based vectors are suitable for the systemic expression of any gene of interest in PVX host plants. The PVX-based vector can be advantageous for the overexpression of proteins, to analyze protein functions in planta or as a system for virus-induced gene silencing.

Here, biological templates have been used to demonstrate that wickability is the single factor dictating CHF on structured superhydrophilic surfaces. The flexibility of biotemplating using the Tobacco mosaic virus has been leveraged to create surfaces with varying scales, morphologies, and roughness factors. Their wickabilities have been quantified via the wicked volume flux, a phenomenological parameter analogous to the contact angle, and the role of wickability on CHF has been demonstrated using data from over three dozen individual surfaces. These results are repeatable and independent of the substrate material, surface fouling, structure material, morphology, and contact angle as well as the structure scale. An experimentally validated correlation for CHF has been reported on the basis of the dimensionless wickability. Additionally, the surfaces have achieved a CHF of 257 W/cm(2) for water, representing the highest reported value to date for superhydrophilic surfaces. While the role of wickability on CHF has often been cited anecdotally, this work provides a quantitative measure of the phenomena and provides a framework for designing and optimizing coatings for further enhancement.

Î²C1 ORF encoded by the Î²-satellite is the symptom determinant and a strong suppressor of post transcriptional gene silencing. To create a virus induced gene silencing vector based upon the Î²-satellite associated with BYVMV the Î²C1 ORF was replaced with multiple cloning sites. GFP transgene and plant endogenous genes Su, PDS, PCNA and AGO1 were cloned into Î²-satellite based VIGS vector. GFP expression was silenced in the GFP expressing transgenic 16c Nicotiana benthamiana plants infiltrated with VIGS vector carrying GFP gene inside. N. benthamiana plants infiltrated with the VIGS vector harboring the endogenous genes Su, PDS, PCNA and AGO1 produced the phenotypic symptoms yellowing of the veins, photobleaching of the veins, stunting of the plant and upward leaf curling, respectively.

Complete nucleotide sequences of DNA-A and DNA-B components of four bipartite begomovirus isolates associated with symptomatic jatropha plants collected from three geographical locations in the DO were determined. Sequence comparisons revealed highest identities (91 to 92%) with the DNA-A component of an isolate of Jatropha mosaic virus (JMV) from Jamaica, indicating that the bipartite begomovirus isolates from the DO are strains of JMV. When introduced into jatropha seedlings by particle bombardment, the cloned components of the JMV strains from the DO induced stunting and yellow mosaic, indistinguishable from symptoms observed in the field, thereby fulfilling Koch's postulates for the disease. The JMV strains also induced disease symptoms in Nicotiana benthamiana, tobacco, and several cultivars of common bean from the Andean gene pool, including one locally grown in the DO. Asymmetry in the infectivity and symptomatology of pseudorecombinants provided further support for the strain designation of the JMV isolates from the DO. Thus, JMV in the DO is a complex of genetically distinct strains that have undergone local evolution and have the potential to cause disease in crop plants.",eng,,,,2014,8,28,ppublish,"Begomovirus|Cluster Analysis|DNA, Viral|Dominican Republic|Fabaceae|Genome, Viral|Jatropha|Molecular Sequence Data|Mosaic Viruses|Phylogeny|Plant Diseases|Seedlings|Sequence Alignment|Sequence Analysis, DNA|Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid|Tobacco",D053839|D016000|D004279|D004293|D007887|D016679|D031286|D008969|D009029|D010802|D010935|D036226|D016415|D017422|D012689|D014026,

Here, two heat-shock cognate (Hsc70) isoforms were identified as part of the coat protein (CP)/Hsc70 complex in vivo, following full-length PepMV and CP agroinoculation. PepMV accumulation was severely reduced in Hsp70 virus-induced gene silenced and in quercetin-treated Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Similarly, in vitro-transcribed as well as virion RNA input levels were reduced in quercetin-treated protoplasts, suggesting an essential role for Hsp70 in PepMV replication. As for Potato virus X, the PepMV CP and triple gene-block protein 1 (TGBp1) self-associate and interact with each other in vitro but, unlike in the prototype, both PepMV proteins represent suppressors of transgene-induced RNA silencing with different modes of action; CP is a more efficient suppressor of RNA silencing, sequesters the silencing signal by preventing its spread to neighboring cells and its systemic movement. Here, we provide evidence for additional roles of the PepMV CP and host-encoded Hsp70 in viral infection, the first as a truly multifunctional protein able to specifically bind to a host chaperone and to counterattack an RNA-based defense mechanism, and the latter as an essential factor for PepMV infection.",eng,,,,2014,8,28,ppublish,"Capsid Proteins|Genes, Reporter|HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins|Lycopersicon esculentum|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plant Proteins|Plants, Genetically Modified|Potexvirus|Protein Binding|RNA Interference|Recombinant Fusion Proteins|Seedlings|Tobacco|Transgenes|Virus Replication",D036022|D017930|D018840|D018551|D010935|D018515|D010940|D030821|D017863|D011485|D034622|D011993|D036226|D014026|D019076|D014779,

1223,25150720,Nature nanotechnology,Design and self-assembly of simple coat proteins for artificial viruses.,10.1038/nnano.2014.169,"Viruses are among the simplest biological systems and are highly effective vehicles for the delivery of genetic material into susceptible host cells. Artificial viruses can be used as model systems for providing insights into natural viruses and can be considered a testing ground for developing artificial life. Moreover, they are used in biomedical and biotechnological applications, such as targeted delivery of nucleic acids for gene therapy and as scaffolds in material science. In a natural setting, survival of viruses requires that a significant fraction of the replicated genomes be completely protected by coat proteins. Complete protection of the genome is ensured by a highly cooperative supramolecular process between the coat proteins and the nucleic acids, which is based on reversible, weak and allosteric interactions only. However, incorporating this type of supramolecular cooperativity into artificial viruses remains challenging. Here, we report a rational design for a self-assembling minimal viral coat protein based on simple polypeptide domains. Our coat protein features precise control over the cooperativity of its self-assembly with single DNA molecules to finally form rod-shaped virus-like particles. We confirm the validity of our design principles by showing that the kinetics of self-assembly of our virus-like particles follows a previous model developed for tobacco mosaic virus. We show that our virus-like particles protect DNA against enzymatic degradation and transfect cells with considerable efficiency, making them promising delivery vehicles.

Mutations that alter the spatial orientation of the cortical microtubule (MT) array of plants are known to cause important changes in the pattern of cell wall synthesis and developmental phenotypes; however, the consequences of such alterations on other MT-network-associated functions in the cytoplasm are not known. In vivo observations suggested a role of cortical MTs in the formation and movement of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA complexes along the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Thus, to probe the significance of dynamic MT behavior in the coordination of MT-network-associated functions related to TMV infection and, thus, in the formation and transport of RNA complexes in the cytoplasm, we performed an evolution experiment with TMV in Arabidopsis thaliana tor1/spr2 and tor2 mutants with specific defects in MT dynamics and asked whether TMV is sensitive to these changes. We show that the altered cytoskeleton induced genetic changes in TMV that were correlated with efficient spread of infection in the mutant hosts. These observations demonstrate a role of dynamic MT rearrangements and of the MT-associated protein TORTIFOLIA1/SPIRAL2 in cellular functions related to virus spread and indicate that MT dynamics and MT-associated proteins represent constraints for virus evolution and adaptation. The results highlight the importance of the dynamic plasticity of the MT network in directing cytoplasmic functions in macromolecular assembly and trafficking and illustrate the value of experimental virus evolution for addressing the cellular functions of dynamic, long-range order systems in multicellular organisms.

This study investigates the role that Hrip1 plays in responses to abiotic and biotic stress using transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing the Hrip1 gene under the control of the stress-inducible rd29A promoter or constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Bioassays showed that inducible Hrip1 expression in rd29Aâ·Hrip1 transgenic lines had a significantly higher effect on plant height, silique length, plant dry weight, seed germination and root length under salt and drought stress compared to expression in 35Sâ·Hrip1 lines and wild type plants. The level of enhancement of resistance to Botrytis cinerea by the 35Sâ·Hrip1 lines was higher than in the rd29Aâ·Hrip1 lines. Moreover, stress-related gene expression in the transgenic Arabidopsis lines was significantly increased by 200Â mM NaCl and 200Â mM mannitol treatments, and defense genes in the jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling pathway were significantly up-regulated after Botrytis inoculation in the Hrip1 transgenic plants. Furthermore, the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, such as peroxidase and catalase increased after salt and drought stress and Botrytis infection. These results suggested that the Hrip1 protein contributes to abiotic and biotic resistance in transgenic Arabidopsis and may be used as a useful gene for resistance breeding in crops. Although the constitutive expression of Hrip1 is suitable for biotic resistance, inducible Hrip1 expression is more responsive for abiotic resistance.

It was shown that the infectivity and viral coat protein content in leaves inoculated with a mixture of TMV (2 Î¼g/mL) and chitosan (1 mg/mL) were lower in the early period of infection (3 days after inoculation), by 63% and 66% respectively, than in leaves inoculated with TMV only. Treatment of leaves with chitosan 24 h before inoculation with TMV also caused the antiviral effects, but these were less apparent than when the virus and polysaccharide were applied simultaneously. The inhibitory effects of the agent decreased as the infection progressed. Inoculation of leaves with TMV together with chitosan considerably enhanced the activity of hydrolases (proteases, RNases) in the leaves, in comparison with leaves inoculated with TMV alone. Electron microscope assays of phosphotungstic acid (PTA)-stained suspensions from infected tobacco leaves showed that, in addition to the normal TMV particles (18 nm in diameter, 300 nm long), these suspensions contained abnormal (swollen, ""thin"" and ""short"") virions. The highest number of abnormal virions was found in suspensions from leaves inoculated with a mixture of TMV and chitosan. Immuno-electron microscopy showed that ""thin"" virus particles, in contrast to the particles of normal diameter, lost the ability to bind to specific antiserum. It seems that the chitosan-induced activation of hydrolases stimulates the intracellular degradation of TMV particles and hence hydrolase activation may be considered to be one of the polysaccharide-mediated cellular defense mechanisms that limit virus accumulation in cells.

Total RNAs extracted with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from symptomatic samples were tested in RT-PCR using pospiviroids generic primers PSTVd-32/33 (1), designed to amplify the whole genome of Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), Tomato apical stunt viroid (TASVd), and Columnea latent viroid (CLVd), and CEVd-FW/RE primers, designed to amplify the whole genome of Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) and TASVd (3). Each of the four samples yielded amplicons of the same size (364 bp) with both primer combinations. The identity of the viroid was then determined by sequencing, on both strands, amplicons obtained from the four symptomatic plants at MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). Sequences obtained were identical, showing the highest nucleotide identity (99.7%) with the TASVd isolate Sj1 (AM777161), identified in Germany on Solanum jasminoides. The sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. HG916812) and the field isolate named To1-IT. Two other cases of pospiviroid infection in tomato in Italy have been reported so far and the viroid species detected were PSTVd (2) and CLVd (4), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of TASVd infecting tomato in Italy. The origin of this infection is still unclear, although based on the biological properties and sequence similarity, the To1-IT isolate probably originated from an ornamental species, most likely S. jasminoides, as recently reported for other tomato TASVd isolates, according to their biological and genetic features (5).

1237,30708805,Plant disease,First Report of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus Infecting Eustoma (Eustoma grandiflorum) in Korea.,10.1094/PDIS-02-14-0162-PDN,"Eustoma (Eustoma grandiflorum), also called lisianthus, belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is cultivated for flower production globally (1), including in Korea. At least 10 viruses can infect eustoma, including Cucumber mosaic virus (genus Cucumovirus), Tobacco mosaic virus (genus Tobamovirus), Tomato spotted wilt virus (genus Tospovirus), and Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV, genus Begomovirus) (1,2). In December 2012, disease symptoms such as leaf curling and stunting were observed on eustoma plants grown in Gumi, Korea, where TYLCV outbreak was reported on tomato farms. In a eustoma greenhouse, about 5% of eustoma plants showed the leaf curling and stunting symptoms. Total DNA was isolated from 15 symptomatic eustoma plants with a Viral Gene-spin Viral DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Seongnam, Korea) and viral DNA was amplified by rolling circle amplification (TempliPhi Amplification Kit, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden) following the manufacturer's instructions. All amplicons were digested with the restriction enzyme SacI (TaKaRa Bio, Shiga, Japan) and 2.8-kb DNA fragments were verified on an agarose gel. Fifteen digested DNA fragments were purified from the gel, ligated into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and sequenced (Macrogen, Seoul, Korea, GenBank Accession No. KF225312.1). A BLAST search exhibited a 99% identity to TYLCV previously reported in Korea (GenBank HM856911.1). This is the first report of TYLCV in eustoma plants in Korea. To identify the movement and replication of TYLCV in infected eustoma plants, PCR and Southern hybridization analysis were performed with samples from four organs (flower, leaf, stem, and root) of three individual TYLCV-infected plants. TYLCV TYL DNA from each organ sample was amplified using 2Ã Taq PCR MasterMix (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) with TYLCV-specific primers (TYLCV-F: 5'-ATATTACCGGATGGCCGCGCCT-3', CV-R: 5'-TCCACGGGGAACATCAGGGCTT-3'). Single-stranded as well as double-stranded TYLCV DNA were identified from all organs of symptomatic eustoma, indicating TYLCV can replicate and move systemically in eustoma plants. Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci)-mediated plant-to-plant viral transmission was performed with one TYLCV-infected eustoma plant and five healthy eustoma plants and revealed that 80% (4 of 5) of the eustoma plants were infected by whitefly-mediated transmission. These results indicate that TYLCV-infected eustoma plants could act as virus reservoirs to healthy eustoma plants as well as other potential TYLCV hosts, such as tomatoes. In Korea, TYLCV has been the most notorious plant virus since 2008 (3), but, until now, TYLCV infection in eustoma plants has not been reported in Korea. References: (1) C. C. Chen et al.

1238,30708804,Plant disease,First Report of Tomato mosaic virus on Common Sow Thistle in Iran.,10.1094/PDIS-03-14-0220-PDN,"The natural incidence of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) in common sow thistle (Sonchus oleraceus) from vegetable fields was assessed to determine the role of this weed species as a virus inoculum source. Twenty sow thistle plants with virus-like foliar symptoms including mosaic and malformations were collected from five vegetable fields in Tehran province, Iran, and analyzed by double antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA for the presence of ToMV, Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) using specific polyclonal antibodies (Agdia, Elkhart, IN). Six out of the 20 sow thistle plants tested by ELISA were infected with ToMV. This virus was detected in three of five vegetable fields surveyed, while CMV and TMV were not detected. Mosaic symptoms were associated with the ToMV infection, similar to those caused by TMV in common sow thistle in Iran (2). Viral infection was confirmed by RT-PCR using previously described specific primers to amplify a region in the coat protein gene of ToMV (3). The RT-PCR resulted in the amplification of an expected fragment of ~480 bp from ToMV-infected but not from healthy plants. The nucleotide sequence of the amplified DNA fragment was purified (GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit, Fermentas, Germany), directly sequenced, and deposited in GenBank as Accession No. KF527464. BLAST analysis showed 95 to 97% and 98 to 100% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, with comparable sequences of other ToMV isolates (GenBank AF062519, FN985165, GQ280794, and JX857634). Mechanical inoculation of sow thistle plants with sap of symptomatic sow thistles reproduced symptoms of field-infected sow thistles. The presence of ToMV in the inoculated plants was confirmed by ELISA and RT-PCR. This suggested that ToMV could be the causal agent of the disease on sow thistle. In our earlier studies, the distribution and genetic diversity of ToMV isolates infecting vegetable crops and weed plants were studied (1); however, to our knowledge, this is the first report of ToMV infecting common sow thistle in Iran.

1239,30708800,Plant disease,Tobacco: A New Natural Host of Tomato chlorosis virus in Spain.,10.1094/PDIS-01-14-0083-PDN,"In March 2013, symptoms of mild leaf curling, mosaic, and interveinal yellowing were observed in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants grown in a row surrounding the exterior of a greenhouse containing a tomato crop in GuÃ­a de Isora, Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain). The tobacco plants were found lightly infested by the whitefly (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) Bemisia tabaci. The greenhouses in this area are devoted to the commercial production of tomato. The farmers grow some tobacco plants inside and outside of them as a reservoir of parasitoids and depredators of B. tabaci. This insect is the natural vector of the main viruses severely affecting tomato in the Canary Islands, the begomovirus Tomato yellow leaf curl virus and the crinivirus Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV). ToCV was detected in Spain in 1997 (2) and has become established in most of the coastal provinces of eastern and southern continental Spain and in the Canary Islands. Approximately 50% of the tomato plants grown inside the greenhouse close to the tobacco plants showed typical ToCV symptoms, and infection by this virus was confirmed in the seven plants tested by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using specific coat protein gene (CP) primers (see below). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) from leaves of five tobacco plants showing the symptoms mentioned above and analyzed by dot-blot hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes to the CP gene of ToCV. Positive signal was obtained for all five plants. RT-PCR reactions were performed with specific primers for the detection of ToCV, MA380(+) (5'-GTGAGACCCCGATGACAGAT-3') and MA381(-) (5'-TACAGTTCCTTGCCCTCGTT-3'), specific to the CP gene (ToCV RNA 2) (3), and MA396(+) (5'-TGGTCGAACAGTTTGAGAGC-3') and MA397(-) (5'-TGAACTCGAATTGGGACAGA-3'), specific to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (ToCV RNA 1) (1). DNA fragments of the expected size (436 and 763 bp, respectively) were obtained, thus supporting the presence of ToCV in the symptomatic samples. The amplified product of the RdRp gene fragment from one sample was directly sequenced (Macrogen Inc., South Korea) and resulted closely related to ToCV isolates from Sudan (GenBank Accession No. JN411686, 99.6% nt identity) and Spain (DQ983480, 99.4% nt identity), thereby confirming the infection by this virus. Partial sequence of the ToCV isolate from tobacco was deposited in GenBank under accession no. KJ175084. In addition, all five plants resulted positive when analyzed by ELISA for Tomato spotted wilt virus and Potato virus Y and by PCR for Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (data not shown), all three viruses reported to infect naturally tobacco. Although tobacco has been reported as an experimental host of ToCV (4), to our knowledge, this is the first report of this species as a natural host of this virus. The finding of ToCV infecting tobacco raises the question of whether this virus could emerge as a pathogen of this crop and questions the use that farmers make of tobacco as reservoirs of natural enemies for whitefly control in tomato.

We constructed ALSV vectors for presenting foreign peptides on the surface of virus particles. In these vectors, peptides can be fused to either of two C-terminal regions of Vp20 (amino acid positions between G171 and P172 or between P172 and L173) or the C-terminus (T192) of Vp24. An ALSV vector presenting the epitope sequences of the coat protein (CP) of zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) could systemically infect host plants and was specifically recognized by antiserum against ZYMV by ELISA, immunoelectron microscopy, and immunoblotting. RT-PCR showed that the epitope sequences up to 20 amino acids were stably maintained in the chimeric ALSV for more than 10 serial passages and at least six months. Purified chimeric ALSV particles induced an immune response and the production of antibodies against ZYMV-CP in rabbits.

Here we tested this hypothesis by employing Bimolecular Fluorescent Complementation (BiFC) as a tool for evaluating protein-protein interactions in living cells. The efficacy of BiFC was validated by a known interaction between replicase protein 1a (p1a) and protein 2a (p2a) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) site of viral replication. Additionally, co-expression in planta of a bona fide pair of interacting protein partners of p1a and p2a had resulted in the assembly of a functional replicase. Subsequent BiFC assays in conjunction with mCherry labeled ER as a fluorescent cellular marker revealed that CP physically interacts with p2a, but not p1a, and this CP:p2a interaction occurs at the cytoplasmic phase of the ER. The significance of the CP:p2a interaction in BMV replication and genome packaging is discussed.

We report that the coat protein (CP) of BaMV is phosphorylated in planta at position serine 241 (S241), in a process involving Nicotiana benthamiana casein kinase 2Î± (NbCK2Î±). BaMV CP and NbCK2Î± colocalize at the plasmodesmata, suggesting that phosphorylation of BaMV may be involved in its movement. S241 was mutated to examine the effects of temporal and spatial dysregulation of phosphorylation on i) the interactions between CP and viral RNA and ii) the regulation of cell-to-cell movement. Replacement of S241 with alanine did not affect RNA binding affinity but moderately impaired cell-to-cell movement. A negative charge at position 241 reduced the ability of CP to bind RNA and severely interfered with cell-to-cell movement. Deletion of residues 240 to 242 increased the affinity of CP to viral RNA and dramatically impaired cell-to-cell movement. A threonine at position 241 changed the binding preference of CP toward genomic RNA and inhibited cell-to-cell movement. Together, these results reveal a fine regulatory mechanism for the cell-to-cell movement of BaMV, which involves the modulation of RNA binding affinity through appropriate phosphorylation of CP by NbCK2Î±.",eng,,,,2014,7,16,ppublish,"Amino Acid Sequence|Capsid Proteins|Casein Kinase II|Genes, Reporter|Models, Biological|Molecular Sequence Data|Mutation|Phosphorylation|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plant Proteins|Plasmodesmata|Potexvirus|Protein Binding|RNA, Viral|Recombinant Fusion Proteins|Tobacco",D000595|D036022|D047390|D017930|D008954|D008969|D009154|D010766|D010935|D018515|D010940|D031425|D017863|D011485|D012367|D011993|D014026,

In this study, we developed a versatile complementation assay for the cell-to-cell and long distance movements of macromolecules by agro-infiltration based on the infectious clones of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). The movement-deficient CMV reporter was constructed by replacing the MP on RNA 3 with ER targeted GFP. The ectopic expression of CMV MP was able to efficiently move the RNA3-MP::erGFP reporter from the original cell to neighboring cells, whereas CMV MP-M5 mutant was unable to initiate the movement. Importantly, the presence of CMV RNA1 and RNA2 can dramatically amplify the movement signals once the RNA3-MP::erGFP reporter moves out of the original cell. The appropriate observation time for this movement complementation assay was at 48-72 hours post infiltration (hpi), whereas the optimal incubation temperature was between 25 and 28 Â°C. The ectopic co-expression of MPs from other virus genera, NSm from tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV) or NSvc4 from rice stripe tenuivirus (RSV), could also facilitate the movement of the RNA3::erGFP reporter from the original cell into other cells. The chimeric mutant virus created by substituting the MP of CMV RNA3 with NSm from TSWV or NSvc4 from RSV move systemically in Nicotiana benthamiana plants by agro-infiltration. This agro-infiltration complementation assay is simple, efficient and reliable.

Arabidopsis calmodulin-like protein 39 (At-rgsCaM) is related to known regulators of RNA silencing in tomato and Nicotiana tabacum. Geminivirus AL2 protein functions to suppress post-transcriptional and transcriptional gene silencing, possibly through induction of an endogenous regulator. In support of this, the At-rgsCaM promoter responds to Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) AL2 in protoplasts and geminivirus infection increases rgsCaM expression in Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana. Further, over-expression of rgsCaM leads to increased susceptibility to infection, as a consequence of increased viral DNA loads. It has been shown that rgsCaM may target silencing suppressors of RNA viruses for degradation via the autophagy pathway. This interaction occurs within the cytoplasm, but AL2 interacts with rgsCaM in the nucleus. It is tempting to speculate that AL2 may act to sequester rgsCaM in the nucleus to prevent targeting of AL2 for degradation.

We also present a numerical method to calculate corrected distributions of bionanoparticles by separating the contribution of the diffusive transfer function. The corrected distribution is about 20% narrower than the empirical distributions. Even with the correction, the reduced width of the mobility distribution is about a factor of 2 larger than the diffusive transfer function. The additional broadening could result from the nonuniform conformation of bionanoparticles and from the presence of volatile impurities or solvent adducts.

The mathematical model and numerical process were elaborated to extract the viscoelastic properties from the indentation data. The adhesion between the AFM tip and the sample was included in the indentation model. Through the functional equation method, the elastic solution for the indentation model was extended to the viscoelastic solution so that the time dependent force vs. displacement relation could be attained. To simplify the solving of the differential equation, a standard solid model was modified to obtain the elastic and viscoelastic components of the sample.

Scotch Bonnet in Florida.,10.1094/PDIS-12-13-1276-PDN,"Scotch bonnet (Capsicum chinense) is a tropical hot pepper variety that is grown in South America, the Caribbean Islands, and in Florida, and is an important cash crop. In Florida, scotch bonnet is grown on ~100 acres annually. Virus-like leaf symptoms including mosaic and yellow mottling were observed on scotch bonnet plants in a field at Quincy, FL, with a disease incidence of ~5%. Two symptomatic and one non-symptomatic plant sample were collected from this field for identification of the causal agent associated with the symptoms. Viral inclusion assays (2) of the epidermal tissues of the symptomatic scotch bonnet samples using Azure A stain indicated the presence of spherical aggregates of crystalline inclusion bodies. Testing of the symptomatic samples using lateral flow immunoassays (Immunostrips, Agdia, Elkhart, IN) specific to Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Potato virus Y (PVY), Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), and Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), showed a positive reaction only to CMV. The sap from an infected leaf sample ground in 0.01 M Sorensons phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) was used to mechanically inoculate one healthy scotch bonnet plant (tested negative for CMV with Immunostrip) at the 2- to 3-leaf stage. The inoculated plant developed mild mosaic and mottling symptoms 12 to 14 days post inoculation. The presence of CMV in the mechanically inoculated plant was further verified using CMV Immunostrips. Total RNA was extracted (RNeasy Plant Mini Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) from the previously collected two symptomatic and one non-symptomatic scotch bonnet samples. The samples were subjected to reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR assays using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), and using multiplex RT-PCR primer sets (1). The primers were designed to differentiate the CMV subgroup I and II, targeting the partial coat protein gene and the 3'UTR. The RT-PCR assays using the multiplex primers produced an amplicon of 590 bp, with the CMV subgroup I primers. The RT-PCR product was only amplified from the symptomatic leaf samples. The obtained amplicons were gel eluted, and directly sequenced bi-directionally (GenBank Accession Nos. KF805389 and KF805390). BLAST analysis of these sequences showed 97 to 98% nucleotide identities with the CMV isolates in the NCBI database. The isolates collected in Florida exhibited highest identity (98%) with the CMV isolate from tomato (DQ302718). These results revealed the association of CMV subgroup I with symptomatic scotch bonnet leaf samples.

1250,30708883,Plant disease,First Report of Grapevine Pinot gris virus Infecting Grapevine in Slovenia.,10.1094/PDIS-11-13-1137-PDN,"Unusual virus-like symptoms were first observed in 2001 on grapevine cvs. Pinot gris and Sauvignonasse in vineyards from the western part of Slovenia. Symptomatic plants showed shortened internodes, poor leaf development, mottling, and deformations of leaves that resulted in poor growth of symptomatic plants. In 2003 and 2004, several samples were tested for Arabis mosaic virus, Cherry leafroll virus, Grapevine fanleaf virus, Raspberry bushy dwarf virus, Strawberry latent ringspot virus, Tomato black ring virus, Tomato ringspot virus, and Tobacco ringspot virus by DAS-ELISA, but none of them could be confirmed as the cause of the observed symptoms. During intensive visual inspections between 2002 and 2006, the symptoms were observed on most grapevine cultivars grown in the Primorska region but predominantly on the two previously mentioned cultivars. In Trentino, northern Italy, similar virus-like symptoms, i.e., chlorotic mottling, puckering and deformation of the leaves, reduced yield, and low quality of the berries were observed in grapevine plants cv. Pinot gris in 2003 and in cvs. Traminer and Pinot noir in 2009 (2). No common grapevine viruses could be associated with the disease. In 2012, a new trichovirus named Grapevine Pinot gris virus (GPGV) was found in Pinot gris plants using deep sequencing. The virus was also detected in symptomless plants (2). GPGV was later reported also from Korea causing inner necrosis of berries and poor fruit set in grapevine cv. Tamnara (1). In 2012, 42 leaf samples from mostly symptomatic grapevine plants of cvs. Pinot gris, Pinot noir, and Muscat blanc were collected at three locations in the Primorska region. Total RNA was extracted from leaves using the MagMAX Express magnetic particle processor with MagMAX-96 Total RNA Isolation Kit and Plant RNA Isolation Aid in Lysis Binding Solution Concentrate (all by Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). DNA fragments of 1,049 bp corresponding to the movement protein gene were successfully amplified by RT-PCR from 40 samples using primers GPgV5619 and GPgV6668 (2). Amplification products from three plants were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. The sequences were deposited in the EBI database under the accession numbers HG738850 to 52. All the nucleotide sequences shared 97.4 to 97.6% identity with GPGV from Italy (sequence FR877530) and 97.1 to 98.2% amino acid identity within the translated region. To our knowledge, this is the first report of GPGV in Slovenia. The disease seems to be spreading extensively in the Primorska region, causing considerable economic losses, and in 2013 it was also observed in other regions of Slovenia. Since the virus could be found in symptomless plants in Italy and in Slovenia, its role in the development of the disease should be further investigated. References: (1) I. S. Cho et al. New Dis.

Among these interactions, the onset of systemic infection is a fundamental variable in studying both within- and between-host infection dynamics, with implications in epidemiology. Here, we developed a mechanistic model using probabilistic and spatio-temporal concepts to explain dynamic signatures of virus systemic infection. The model dealt with the inherent characteristic of plant viruses to use two different and sequential stages for their within-host propagation: cell-to-cell movement from the initial infected cell and systemic spread by reaching the vascular system. We identified the speed of cell-to-cell movement and the number of primary infection foci in the inoculated leaf as the key factors governing this dynamic process. Our results allowed us to quantitatively understand the timing of the onset of systemic infection, describing this global process as a consequence of local spread of viral populations.

Recent studies of Phytophthora have led to the identification of various apoplastic elicitors known to trigger plant immunity. Here, we provide evidence that the protein encoded by OPEL of Phytophthora parasitica is a novel elicitor. Homologues of OPEL were identified only in oomycetes, but not in fungi and other organisms. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that OPEL is expressed throughout the development of P.âparasitica and is especially highly induced after plant infection. Infiltration of OPEL recombinant protein from Escherichia coli into leaves of Nicotiana tabacum (cv. Samsun NN) resulted in cell death, callose deposition, the production of reactive oxygen species and induced expression of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity markers and salicylic acid-responsive defence genes. Moreover, the infiltration conferred systemic resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including Tobacco mosaic virus, the bacteria wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum and P.âparasitica. In addition to the signal peptide, OPEL contains three conserved domains: a thaumatin-like domain, a glycine-rich protein domain and a glycosyl hydrolase (GH) domain. Intriguingly, mutation of a putative laminarinase active site motif in the predicted GH domain abolished its elicitor activity, which suggests enzymatic activity of OPEL in triggering the defence response.

Each coat protein was synthesized and cloned into a pBYR2fp single replicon vector. Target protein expression in cells containing p19 was fourfold higher than that of cells lacking p19. After agroinfiltration, protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantitative image analyzer. Quantitative analysis showed that BMVCP, CMVCP, and MRFVCP concentrations were 0.5, 1.0, and 0.8 mgâÂ·âg(-1) leaf fresh weight, respectively. VLPs were purified by sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation and then analyzed by transmission electron microscopy.

Wild-type NB plants infected with a chimeric PPV virus (PPV::GFP) exhibited affected leaves with mosaic chlorosis congruent to GFP fluorescence at 21 day post-inoculation; transgenic lines depicted a range of phenotypes from fully resistant to susceptible. ELISA values and GFP fluorescence intensities were used to select transgenic-resistant (TG-R) and transgenic-susceptible (TG-S)Â lines for further characterization of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by large-scale small RNA sequencing. In infected TG-S and untransformed (WT) plants, the observed siRNAs were nearly exclusively 21- and 22-nt siRNAs that targeted the whole PPV::GFP genome; 24-nt siRNAs were absent in these individuals. Challenged TG-R plants accumulated a full set of 21- to 24-nt siRNAs that were primarily associated with the selected motif-rich regions, indicating that a trans-acting siRNAs process prevented viral multiplication. BLAST analysis identified 13 common siRNA clusters targeting the CP gene. 21-nt siRNA sequences were associated with the 22-nt siRNAs and the scarce 23- and 24-nt molecules in TG-S plants and with most of the observed 22-, 23-, and 24-nt siRNAs in TG-R individuals. These results validate the use of a multi-hot spot silencing vector against PPV and elucidate the molecules by which hairpin-inducing vectors initiate RNAi in vivo.

In this report, we focus on one of the novel CP-binding partners, the Arabidopsis PsbP protein, which is a nuclear-encoded component of the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II. We validated the protein interaction in vitro with pull-down assays, in planta with bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, and during virus infection by co-immunoprecipitations. CP interacted with the chloroplast-targeted PsbP in the cytosol and mutations that prevented the dimerization of CP abolished this interaction. Importantly, PsbP overexpression markedly reduced virus accumulation in infected leaves. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that AMV CP dimers interact with the chloroplast protein PsbP, suggesting a potential sequestration strategy that may preempt the generation of any PsbP-mediated antiviral state.

We further demonstrate readily controlled protein and antibody conjugation capacity by simply varying TMV concentrations, which show negligible negative impact of densely assembled TMVs on protein conjugation and capture capacity. Combined, these results illustrate a facile postfabrication protein conjugation approach with TMV templates assembled onto hydrogel microparticles for improved and controlled protein conjugation and sensing platforms.

Currently, ex vivo DC priming has been the mainstay of DC cancer immunotherapies. However, cell-based treatment modalities are inherently flawed due to a lack of standardization, specialized facilities and personnel, and cost. Therefore, direct modes of DC manipulation, circumventing the need for ex vivo culture, must be investigated. To facilitate the development of next-generation, in vivo targeted DC vaccines, we characterized the DC interaction and activation potential of the Tobacco Mosaic virus (TMV), a plant virus that enjoys a relative ease of production and the ability to deliver protein payloads via surface conjugation. In this study we show that TMV is readily taken up by mouse bone marrow-derived DCs, in vitro. Footpad injection of fluorophore-labeled TMV reveals preferential uptake by draining lymph node resident DCs in vivo. Uptake leads to activation, as measured by the upregulation of key DC surface markers. When peptide antigen-conjugated TMV is injected into the footpad of mice, DC-mediated uptake and activation leads to robust antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell responses, as measured by antigen-specific tetramer analysis. Remarkably, TMV priming induced a greater magnitude T cell response than Adenovirus (Ad) priming. Finally, TMV is capable of boosting either Ad-induced or TMV-induced antigen-specific T cell responses, demonstrating that TMV, uniquely, does not induce neutralizing self-immunity. Overall, this study elucidates the in vivo DC delivery and activation properties of TMV and indicates its potential as a vaccine vector in stand alone or prime-boost strategies.

In order to enhance resistance to CMV by overexpression of RCY1, A. thaliana was transformed with intron-less RCY1 cDNA construct under the control of strong CaMV35S promoter. Remarkably, a relative amount of RCY1 protein accumulation in the transformants was much lower than that in plants expressing genomic RCY1 under the control of its native promoter. To identify a regulatory element of RCY1 that could cause such differential levels of RCY1 accumulation, a series of RCY1 cDNA and genomic RCY1 constructs were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by the Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration method. Comparative analysis of the level of RCY1 accumulation in the leaf tissues transiently expressing each construct indicated that the intron located in the RCY1-coding region of genomic RCY1, but not the native RCY1 genomic promoter or the 5'-and 3'-untranslated regions of RCY1, was indispensable for high level RCY1 accumulation. The increased levels of RCY1 accelerated plant disease defense reactions. Interestingly, such intron-mediated enhancement of RCY1 accumulation depended neither on the abundance of the RCY1 transcript nor on the RCY1 specific-intron sequence. Taken together, intron-mediated RCY1 expression seems to play a key role in the expression of complete resistance to CMV(Y) by maintaining RCY1 accumulation at high levels.

1265,24903327,The Journal of general virology,Effects of modifying alternative respiration on nitric oxide-induced virus resistance and PR1 protein accumulation.,10.1099/vir.0.066662-0,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an important defensive signal in plants but its effects on virus infection are not well understood. Administration of NO-releasing compounds immediately before inoculation of tobacco leaves with potato virus X and tobacco mosaic virus decreased the accumulation of virus, indicating that NO can induce resistance rapidly. Resistance induction was inhibited by co-administration with an NO-scavenging compound or when experiments were done in transgenic tobacco plants expressing increased alternative respiratory pathway capacity due to constitutive expression of the plant mitochondrial enzyme, alternative oxidase (AOX). These results indicate that NO, which inhibits electron transport chain activity, is triggering defensive signalling by inducing changes in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species levels that are in turn regulated by AOX. Experiments using nahG-transgenic plants, which cannot accumulate the defensive plant hormone salicylic acid (SA) showed that NO rapidly induces resistance to virus infection independently of SA. However, this initial state of resistance may be transient. Subsequently, by 5 days post-treatment, NO had caused an increase in pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1) expression (a proxy for increased SA biosynthesis), which correlated with a longer-term state of resistance to virus infection.

In the pSiM24 vector, the size of the backbone of the early binary vector pKYLXM24 (GenBank Accession No. HM036220; a derivative of pKYLX71) was reduced from 12.8 kb to 7.1 kb. The binary vector pSiM24 is composed of the following genetic elements: left and right T-DNA borders, a modified full-length transcript promoter (M24) of Mirabilis mosaic virus with duplicated enhancer domains, three multiple cloning sites, a 3'rbcsE9 terminator, replication functions for Escherichia coli (ColE1) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (pRK2-OriV) and the replicase trfA gene, selectable marker genes for kanamycin resistance (nptII) and ampicillin resistance (bla). The pSiM24 plasmid offers a wide selection of cloning sites, high copy numbers in E. coli and a high cloning capacity for easily manipulating different genetic elements. It has been fully tested in transferring transgenes such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) both transiently (agro-infiltration, protoplast electroporation and biolistic) and stably in plant systems (Arabidopsis and tobacco) using both agrobacterium-mediated transformation and biolistic procedures. Not only reporter genes, several other introduced genes were also effectively expressed using pSiM24 expression vector. Hence, the pSiM24 vector would be useful for various plant biotechnological applications.

A 2b mutant (R46C) that lacks viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR) activity showed an asymptomatic phenotype with low levels of virus accumulation. Tomato spotted wilt virus NSs protein did not complement the virulence of the R46C, although it did restore high-level virus accumulation. However, R46C mutants expressing mutated CP in which the amino acid P129 was mutated to A, E, C, Q, or S induced chlorosis that was associated with reduced expression of chloroplast and photosynthesis related genes (CPRGs) and abnormal chloroplasts with fewer thylakoid membranes. These results suggest that the CP of the CMV pepo strain acquires virulence by amino acid mutations, which causes CPRG repression and chloroplast abnormalities.

Its movement protein (MP) interacts with cortical microtubule (MT)-associated ER sites (C-MERs) to facilitate the formation and transport of ER-associated viral replication complexes (VRCs) along the ER-actin network towards PD. To investigate whether this movement mechanism might be conserved between tobamoviruses, we compared the functions of Oilseed rape mosaic virus (ORMV) MP with those of MP(TMV). We show that MP(ORMV) supports TMV movement more efficiently than MP(TMV). Moreover, MP(ORMV) localizes to C-MERs like MP(TMV) but accumulates to lower levels and does not localize to larger inclusions/VRCs or along MTs, patterns regularly seen for MP(TMV). Our findings extend the role of C-MERs in viral cell-to-cell transport to a virus commonly used for functional genomics in Arabidopsis. Moreover, accumulation of tobamoviral MP in inclusions or along MTs is not required for virus movement.

This work demonstrates the fabrication and characterization of superhydrophobic coatings using a simple scalable nanofabrication technique based on self-assembly of the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) combined with initiated chemical vapor deposition. TMV biotemplating is compatible with a wide range of surface materials and applicable over large areas and complex geometries without the use of any power or heat. The virus-structured coatings fabricated here are macroscopically superhydrophobic (contact angle >170Â°) and have been characterized using environmental electron scanning microscopy showing sustained and robust coalescence-induced ejection of condensate droplets. Additionally, full-field dynamic characterization of these surfaces during condensation in the presence of noncondensable gases is reported. This technique uses optical microscopy combined with image processing algorithms to track the wetting and growth dynamics of 100s to 1000s of microscale condensate droplets simultaneously. Using this approach, over 3 million independent measurements of droplet size have been used to characterize global heat transfer performance as a function of nucleation site density, coalescence length, and the apparent wetted surface area during dynamic loading. Additionally, the history and behavior of individual nucleation sites, including coalescence events, has been characterized. This work elucidates the nature of superhydrophobic condensation and its enhancement, including the role of nucleation site density during transient operation.

Optimization of Agrobacterium cultivation in AB medium allows direct dilution of the bacterial culture in Milli-Q water, simplifying the infiltration process. Among three tested species of Nicotiana, N. excelsiana (N. benthamiana Ã N. excelsior) was selected as the most promising host due to the ease of infiltration, high level of reporter protein production, and about two-fold higher biomass production under controlled environmental conditions.

Further analysis by RT-PCR using Agdia's proprietary pospiviroid group-specific primer resulted in positive reactions in all three samples. To determine which species of pospiviroid was present in these tomato samples, full-genomic products of the expected size (~360 bp) were amplified by RT-PCR using specific primers for PSTVd (4) and cloned using TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, CA). A total of 8 to 10 clones from each isolate were selected for sequencing. Sequences from each clone were nearly identical and the predominant sequence DR13-01 was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KF683200). BLASTn searches into the NCBI database demonstrated that isolate DR13-01 shared 97% sequence identity to PSTVd isolates identified in wild Solanum (U51895), cape gooseberry (EU862231), or pepper (AY532803), and 96% identity to the tomato-infecting PSTVd isolate from the United States (JX280944). The relatively lower genome sequence identity (96%) to the tomato-infecting PSTVd isolate in the United States (JX280944) suggests that PSTVd from the Dominican Republic was likely introduced from a different source, although the exact source that resulted in the current disease outbreak remains unknown. It may be the result of an inadvertent introduction of contaminated tomato seed lots or simply from local wild plants. Further investigation is necessary to determine the likely source and route of introduction of PSTVd identified in the current epidemic. Thus, proper control measures could be recommended for disease management. The detection of this viroid disease outbreak in the Dominican Republic represents further geographic expansion of the viroid disease in tomatoes beyond North America. References: (1). K.-S.

1282,30708510,Plant disease,First Report of Mosaic Disease Caused by Colombian datura virus on Solanum lycopersicum Plants Commercially Cultivated in Japan.,10.1094/PDIS-06-13-0668-PDN,"In 2009, some commercially grown tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, exhibited mosaic symptoms. Ten plants from a total of about 72,000 cultivated plants in the greenhouses showed such symptoms. To identify the causal agent, sap from leaves of the diseased plants was inoculated into Chenopodium quinoa and Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Local necrotic lesions appeared on inoculated leaves of C. quinoa, but no systemic infection was observed. Systemic mosaic symptoms were observed on the N. benthamiana plants inoculated. Single local lesion isolation was performed three times using C. quinoa to obtain a reference isolate for further characterization. N. benthamiana was used for propagation of the isolate. Sap from infected leaves of N. benthamiana was mechanically inoculated into three individual S. lycopersicum cv. Momotaro. Symptoms appearing on inoculated tomatoes were indistinguishable from those of diseased tomato plants found initially in the greenhouse. Flexuous, filamentous particles, ~750 nm long, were observed by electron microscopy in the sap of the tomato plants inoculated with the isolate, indicating that the infecting virus may belong to the family Potyviridae. To determine genomic sequence of the virus, RT-PCR was performed. Total RNA was extracted from the tomato leaves experimentally infected with the isolate using an RNeasy Plant Mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). RT-PCR was performed by using a set of universal, degenerate primers for Potyviruses as previously reported (2). Amplicons (~1,500 bp) generated by RT-PCR were extracted from the gels using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN) and cloned into pCR-BluntII TOPO (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). DNA sequences of three individual clones were determined using a combination of plasmid and virus-specific primers, showing that identity among three clones was 99.8%. A consensus nucleotide sequence of the isolate was deposited in GenBank (AB823816). BLASTn analysis of the nucleotide sequence determined showed 99% identity with a partial sequence in the NIb/coat protein (CP) region of Colombian datura virus (CDV) tobacco isolate (JQ801448). Comparison of the amino acid sequence predicted for the CP with previously reported sequences for CDV (AY621656, AJ237923, EU571230, AM113759, AM113754, and AM113761) showed 97 to 100% identity range. Subsequently, CDV infection in both the original and experimentally inoculated plants was confirmed by RT-PCR using CDV-specific primers (CDVv and CDVvc; [1]), and, hence, the causal agent of the tomato disease observed in greenhouse tomatoes was proved to be CDV. The first case of CDV on tomato was reported in Netherlands (3), indicating that CDV was transmitted by aphids from CDV-infected Brugmansia plants cultivated in the same greenhouse. We carefully investigated whether Brugmansia plants naturally grew around the greenhouses, but we could not find them inside or in proximity to the greenhouses. Therefore, sources of CDV inoculum in Japan are still unclear. This is the first report of a mosaic disease caused by CDV on commercially cultivated S. lycopersicum in Japan. References: (1) D. O.

KY14, a cultivar that is highly susceptible to infection by Peronospora tabacina. The coding sequence of the tobacco phylloplanin gene along with its native signal peptide was fused with GFP at the carboxy terminus. The synthetic chimeric gene (native-phylloplanin-GFP) was placed between the modified Mirabilis mosaic virus full-length transcript promoter with duplicated enhancer domains and the terminator sequence from the rbcSE9 gene. The chimeric gene, expressed in transgenic tobacco, was stably inherited in successive plant generations as shown by molecular characterization, GFP quantification, and confocal fluorescent microscopy. Transgenic plants were morphologically similar to wild-type plants and showed no deleterious effects due to transgene expression. Blue mold-sensitivity assays of tobacco lines were performed by applying P. tabacina sporangia to the upper leaf surface. Transgenic lines expressing the fused synthetic native-phyllopanin-GFP gene in the leaf apoplast showed resistance to infection. Our results demonstrate that in vivo expression of a synthetic fused native-phylloplanin-GFP gene in plants can potentially achieve natural protection against microbial plant pathogens, including P. tabacina in tobacco.

However, the functional importance of soybean MPK6 in disease resistance has not been investigated. Here, we showed that silencing of GmMPK6 in soybean using virus-induced gene silencing mediated by Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) caused stunted growth and spontaneous cell death on the leaves, a typical phenotype of activated defense responses. Consistent with this phenotype, expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and the conjugated form of salicylic acid were significantly increased in GmMPK6-silenced plants. As expected, GmMPK6-silenced plants were more resistant to downy mildew and Soybean mosaic virus compared with vector control plants, indicating a negative role of GmMPK6 in disease resistance. Interestingly, overexpression of GmMPK6, either transiently in Nicotiana benthamiana or stably in Arabidopsis, resulted in hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death. The HR-like cell death was accompanied by increased PR gene expression, suggesting that GmMPK6, like its counterpart in other plant species, also plays a positive role in cell death induction and defense response. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis, we determined that GmMKK4 might function upstream of GmMPK6 and GmMKK4 could interact with GmMPK6 independent of its phosphorylation status. Taken together, our results indicate that GmMPK6 functions as both repressor and activator in defense responses of soybean.

This work intends to show some biological properties of these viruses following plant infections. Agroinfiltration experiments on Nicotiana benthamiana confirmed the efficient systemic expression of M2e peptides, and two point amino acid substitutions in recombinant CPs significantly influenced the symptoms and development of viral infections. Joint expression of RNA interference suppressor protein p19 from tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) did not affect the accumulation of CP-M2e-ser recombinant protein in non-inoculated leaves. RT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from either infected leaves or purified TMV-M2e particles proved the genetic stability of TMVâbased viral vectors. Immunoelectron microscopy of crude plant extracts demonstrated that foreign epitopes are located on the surface of chimeric virions. The rodâshaped geometry of plant-produced M2e epitopes is different from the icosahedral or helical filamentous arrangement of M2e antigens on the carrier virus-like particles (VLP) described earlier. Thereby, we created a simple and efficient system that employs agrobacteria and plant viral vectors in order to produce a candidate broad-spectrum fluÂ vaccine.

Foreign gene expression is an efficient mechanism for getting protein vaccines against different human viral and nonviral diseases. Plants make it easy to deal with safe, inexpensive, and provide trouble-free storage. The broad spectrum of safe gene promoters is being used to avoid risk assessments. Engineered virus-based vectors have no side effect. The process can be manipulated as follows: (a) retrieve and select gene encoding, use an antigenic protein from GenBank and/or from a viral-genome sequence, (b) design and construct hybrid-virus vectors (viral vector with a gene of interest) eventually flanked by plant-specific genetic regulatory elements for constitutive expression for obtaining chimeric virus, (c) gene transformation and/or transfection, for transient expression, into a plant-host model, that is, tobacco, to get protocols processed positively, and then moving into edible host plants, (d) confirmation of protein expression by bioassay, PCR-associated tests (RT-PCR), Northern and Western blotting analysis, and serological assay (ELISA), (e) expression for adjuvant recombinant protein seeking better antigenicity, (f) extraction and purification of expressed protein for identification and dosing, (g) antigenicity capability evaluated using parental or oral delivery in animal models (mice and/or rabbit immunization), and (h) growing of construct-treated edible crops in protective green houses.

Coat protein (CP) is one of the major virulence determinants of CMV, and an amino acid substitution at residue 129 in CP alters the severity of chlorosis, such as pale green chlorosis and white chlorosis, in symptomatic tissues of mosaic leaves of infected tobacco. In this study, we compared the transcriptomes of chlorotic tissues infected with the wild-type pepo strain of CMV and two strains carrying CP mutants with diverse chlorosis severity. Differential gene expression analysis showed that CMV inoculation appeared to have similar effects on the transcriptional expression profiles of the symptomatic chlorotic tissues, and only the magnitude of expression differed among the different CMVs. Gene ontology analysis with biological process and cellular component terms revealed that many nuclear genes related to abiotic stress responses, including responses to cadmium, heat, cold and salt, were up-regulated, whereas chloroplast- and photosynthesis-related genes (CPRGs) were down-regulated, in the chlorotic tissues. Interestingly, the level of CPRG down-regulation was correlated with the severity of chlorosis.

Before replication complex formation, virus-encoded replication proteins specifically recognize genomic RNA molecules and recruit them to sites of replication. Moreover, in many of these viruses, selection of replication templates by the replication proteins occurs preferentially in cis. This property is advantageous to the viruses in several aspects of viral replication and evolution, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been characterized. Here, we used an in vitro translation system to show that a 126-kDa replication protein of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a positive-strand RNA virus, binds a 5'-terminal â¼70-nucleotide region of TMV RNA cotranslationally, but not posttranslationally. TMV mutants that carried nucleotide changes in the 5'-terminal region and showed a defect in the binding were unable to synthesize negative-strand RNA, indicating that this binding is essential for template selection. A C-terminally truncated 126-kDa protein, but not the full-length 126-kDa protein, was able to posttranslationally bind TMV RNA in vitro, suggesting that binding of the 126-kDa protein to the 70-nucleotide region occurs during translation and before synthesis of the C-terminal inhibitory domain. We also show that binding of the 126-kDa protein prevents further translation of the bound TMV RNA. These data provide a mechanistic explanation of how the 126-kDa protein selects replication templates in cis and how fatal collision between translating ribosomes and negative-strand RNA-synthesizing polymerases on the genomic RNA is avoided.

Sequence comparison showed two substitutions (C118Y and T120N) in the movement protein NSm present only in TSWV resistance-breaking (RB) isolates. In this work, transient expression of NSm of three TSWV isolates [RB1 (T120N), RB2 (C118Y) and non-resistance-breaking (NRB)] in Nicotiana benthamiana expressing Sw-5 showed a hypersensitive response (HR) only with NRB.

Finally, co-inoculation of RB and NRB AMV chimeric constructs showed different prevalence of RB or NBR depending on the presence or absence of Sw-5.

A specific vector harboring the 5'-UTR fragment of the Î© sequence from the tobacco mosaic virus and a poly(A) tail of 50 nucleotides led to optimal performance. Second, we developed a simple, two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for high-throughput production of linear templates for yeast CFPS. This procedure allows all functional elements needed for Tx/Tl to be added to an open-reading frame directly by overlap extension PCR. Our two-step PCR method was successfully applied to three reporter proteins: luciferase, green fluorescence protein, and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, yielding 7 to 12.5 Î¼g mL-1 active protein after 1.5-h batch reactions. Surprisingly, the linear templates outperformed plasmid DNA by up to 60%. Hence, the presented CFPS method has the potential to rapidly prepare tens to thousands of DNA templates without time-consuming cloning work. Further, it holds promise for fast and convenient optimization of expression constructs, study of internal ribosome entry site, and production of protein libraries for genome-scale studies.

Using the method of primer extension inhibition (toe-printing), the ribosomal particles were shown to initiate translation at uncapped omega leader when its 5'-end was blocked by a stable RNA-DNA double helix, thus providing evidence for internal initiation. The scanning of the leader sequence and the formation of ribosomal 48S initiation complexes at the initiation AUG codon occurred in the absence of ATP-dependent initiation factor eIF4F, as well as without ATP.

The most successful and generally-applicable approach treats short segments of these filaments as independent ""single particles"", yielding near-atomic resolution for rigid and well-ordered filaments. The single-particle approach can also accommodate filament deformations, yielding sub-nanometer resolution for more flexible filaments. However, in the case of thin and flexible filaments, such as some amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) fibrils, the single-particle approach may fail because helical segments can be curved or otherwise distorted and their alignment can be inaccurate due to low contrast in the micrographs. We developed new software called Frealix that allows the use of arbitrarily short filament segments during alignment to approximate even high curvatures. All segments in a filament are aligned simultaneously with constraints that ensure that they connect to each other in space to form a continuous helical structure. In this paper, we describe the algorithm and benchmark it against datasets of AÎ²(1-40) fibrils and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), both analyzed in earlier work. In the case of TMV, our algorithm achieves similar results to single-particle analysis. In the case of AÎ²(1-40) fibrils, we match the previously-obtained resolution but we are also able to obtain reliable alignments and â¼8-Ã reconstructions from curved filaments.

In addition to their traditional function in coordinating maturation of certain nuclear RNAs, CBs participate in cell cycle regulation, development, and regulation of stress responses. A key ""signature"" component of CBs is coilin, the scaffolding protein essential for CB formation and function. Using an RNA silencing (loss-of-function) approach, we describe here new phenomena whereby coilin also affects, directly or indirectly, a variety of interactions between host plants and viruses that have RNA or DNA genomes. Moreover, the effects of coilin on these interactions are manifested differently: coilin contributes to plant defense against tobacco rattle virus (tobravirus), tomato black ring virus (nepovirus), barley stripe mosaic virus (hordeivirus), and tomato golden mosaic virus (begomovirus). In contrast, with potato virus Y (potyvirus) and turnip vein clearing virus (tobamovirus), coilin serves to increase virus pathogenicity. These findings show that interactions with coilin (or CBs) may involve diverse mechanisms with different viruses and that these mechanisms act at different phases of virus infection. Thus, coilin (CBs) has novel, unexpected natural functions that may be recruited or subverted by plant viruses for their own needs or, in contrast, are involved in plant defense mechanisms that suppress host susceptibility to the viruses.

We found that CMV infection of susceptible tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) also induced SA accumulation. Utilization of mutant 2b proteins expressed during infection of tobacco showed that the N- and C-terminal domains, which had previously been implicated in regulation of symptom induction, were both required for subversion of SA-induced resistance, while all mutants tested except those affecting the putative phosphorylation domain had lost the ability to prime SA accumulation and expression of the SA-induced marker gene PR-1.",eng,2014,03,14,2014,3,19,ppublish,"Arabidopsis|Cucumovirus|Genes, Viral|Mutation|Plant Diseases|Plant Growth Regulators|Plant Leaves|Plants, Genetically Modified|Protein Structure, Tertiary|RNA Interference|Salicylic Acid|Tobacco|Viral Proteins",D017360|D017799|D005814|D009154|D010935|D010937|D018515|D030821|D017434|D034622|D020156|D014026|D014764,

Here, we focus on some perspectives of a special localization microscopy embodiment, spectral precision distance/position determination microscopy (SPDM). SPDM permits the use of conventional fluorophores or fluorescent proteins together with standard sample preparation conditions employing an aqueous buffered milieu and typically monochromatic excitation. This allowed superresolution imaging and studies on the aggregation state of modified tobacco mosaic virus particles on the nanoscale with a single-molecule localization accuracy of better than 8 nm, using standard fluorescent dyes in the visible spectrum. To gain a better understanding of cell entry mechanisms during influenza A virus infection, SPDM was used in conjunction with algorithms for distance and cluster analyses to study changes in the distribution of virus particles themselves or in the distribution of infection-related proteins, the hepatocyte growth factor receptors, in the cell membrane on the single-molecule level. Not requiring TIRF (total internal reflection) illumination, SPDM was also applied to study the molecular arrangement of gp36.5/m164 glycoprotein (essentially associated with murine cytomegalovirus infection) in the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear membrane inside cells with single-molecule resolution.

In such fungi, RNAi has been induced by expressing hairpin RNAs delivered through plasmids, sequences integrated in fungal or plant genomes, or by RNAi generated in planta by a plant virus infection. All these approaches have some drawbacks ranging from instability of hairpin constructs in fungal cells to difficulties in preparing and handling transgenic plants to silence homologous sequences in fungi grown on these plants. Here we show that RNAi can be expressed in the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum acutatum (strain C71) by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) without a plant intermediate, but by using the direct infection of a recombinant virus vector based on the plant virus, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). We provide evidence that a wild-type isolate of TMV is able to enter C71 cells grown in liquid medium, replicate, and persist therein. With a similar approach, a recombinant TMV vector carrying a gene for the ectopic expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) induced the stable silencing of the GFP in the C. acutatum transformant line 10 expressing GFP derived from C71. The TMV-based vector also enabled C. acutatum to transiently express exogenous GFP up to six subcultures and for at least 2 mo after infection, without the need to develop transformation technology.

1312,30708760,Plant disease,First Report of Tobacco streak virus Infecting Pigeon Pea (Cajanus cajan) in India.,10.1094/PDIS-07-13-0731-PDN,"Pigeon pea is an important pulse crop grown in diversified cropping systems in India. In the rainy season of August 2011 and September 2012, pigeon pea cv. LRG 30 plants with leaf necrosis having wrinkled margin on one side were observed in Kadiri mandal of the Anantapuram district of Andhra Pradesh (A.P.), India. Symptoms included necrotic spots on young leaves followed by wilting of leaves, petiole and branch/axillary shoot proliferation, with small leaves having mosaic symptoms. Symptomatic leaves were sap-inoculated onto 10 seedlings of cowpea (cv. Pusa Komal) using 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Localized necrotic lesions developed in all the inoculated plants after 2 days post inoculation. Field symptoms were reproduced on healthy pigeon pea upon back inoculation using single lesions of infected cowpea leaves. In direct antigen coating (DAC)-ELISA, all the infected pigeon pea and cowpea leaf samples were positive to a polyclonal antiserum specific to Tobacco streak virus (TSV) supplied by ICRISAT, India. Total RNA was extracted using infected pigeon pea and healthy leaf samples by TRI Reagent (Sigma). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out using primers specific to the coat protein (CP) gene of TSV (1). A product of the 700-bp DNA fragment was obtained in field-infected pigeon pea samples but not in healthy controls. The amplicon was cloned into PTZ57R/T using the Ins TA clone PCR kit (Fermentas). Recombinant clone was sequenced in both directions and the CP gene sequence obtained was deposited in GenBank (KF220492). Sequence analysis of the CP gene of TSV from pigeon pea shared 98 to 100% identity with Indian TSV isolates originating from different hosts including groundnut (FJ355948), mung bean (FJ749259), and sunflower (DQ864448), and 88 to 92% similarity with TSV type isolate (white clover: X00435) both at nucleotide and amino acid levels. TSV belongs to the genus Ilarvirus of family Bromoviride and has a wide host range. TSV is pollen borne, assisted by thrips causing mechanical injury (2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of TSV on pigeon pea in India and was widespread in Anantapuram, Kadapa, Kurnool, and Mahbubnagar districts of A.P. Yield loss depends on the stage of infection as early infection resulted in complete failure of the crop. TSV was prevalent on many legume crops such as black gram, green gram, and groundnut in A.P, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Maharashtra states (3). TSV infection of pigeon pea may pose a serious implication for pulse production. References: (1). A. I. Bhat et al. Arch. Virol. 147:651, 2002. (2). M. Sharman et al.

1313,30708759,Plant disease,First Report of Tomato chlorotic spot virus in Processing Tomatoes in the Dominican Republic.,10.1094/PDIS-07-13-0685-PDN,"Processing tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) are an important industry in the Dominican Republic. In November 2012, symptoms typical of tospovirus infection (bronzing, chlorosis, and necrosis of leaves) appeared in numerous processing tomato fields in the North (>50% incidence in some fields) and a few fields in the South (<1% incidence). Plants in affected fields had large populations of thrips on leaves and in flowers. Symptomatic leaves from four fields in the North (Guayubin, Juan Gomez, Hatillo Palma, and Navarrete) and one field in the South (Azua) were positive for infection by Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) when tested with AgDia immunostrips. However, RT-PCR tests of these samples with a TSWV N gene primer pair (1) were negative, whereas the expected size 590 and 777 bp fragments were amplified with N gene primers for Groundnut ringspot virus (GRSV, 2) and Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV; NF5'ATGTCTAAGGTCAAGCTCACC3' and NR5'TTATGCAACACCTGAAATTTTGGC3'), respectively. These fragments were sequenced (KF420087 and KF420088) and comparisons revealed 99, 83, and 80% identities with N gene sequences of TCSV, GRSV, and TSWV, respectively. Portions of the L, M, and S RNAs were amplified from symptomatic leaves by RT-PCR with degenerate L (TOSPO L For: CWGARGATRTDATWATAAATAAYAATGC and TOSPO L Rev: GCATCNACAGAWATYTTCCA), M (TOSPO M For: AGAGCAATCAGTGCATC and TOSPO M Rev: CTTRCAGGCTTCAATRAAKGC), and S (3) primers. The expected L, M, and S RNA fragments of 450, 849, and 871 bp, respectively, were amplified and sequenced (KF420089, KF420090, and KF420091). Sequence comparisons revealed 98, 83, and 78%; 99, 94, and 82%; and 99, 83, and 77% identities with TCSV-, GRSV-, and TSWV-L, M, and S RNA sequences, respectively. Weed surveys around tomato fields revealed tospovirus symptoms (chlorosis, mosaic/mottle, and necrosis) in leaves of two common species, Boerhavia erecta and Cleome viscosa. Symptomatic leaves were positive with TSWV immunostrips, whereas RT-PCR and sequence analyses of these leaves from C. viscosa (one each from the North and South) and B. erecta (one from the South) revealed infection with TCSV (99% identities for L, M, and S RNA fragments). In contrast, leaves from pepper plants with tospovirus symptoms (chlorosis, ringspots, and necrosis) in a commercial greenhouse in the North (Villa Gonzales) were positive for TSWV based on immunostrips and RT-PCR and sequence analyses. Dot blot hybridization tests with the cloned TCSV L RNA fragment confirmed TCSV infection in PCR-positive tomato plants and weeds, whereas no hybridization signal was detected for TSWV-infected peppers or uninfected tomatoes. Identification of thrips collected from symptomatic tomato plants at Navarrete and Hatillo Palma revealed that tomato thrips (Frankliniella schultzei) was predominant (90%) along with Western flower thrips (F. occidentalis) (10%), whereas only F. schultzei was identified from weeds in the South. Thus, TCSV is causing the tospovirus disease of processing tomato, and this is the first report of this virus in the Dominican Republic. This is also consistent with F. schultzei being an efficient vector of TCSV. An IPM program for TCSV based on planting thrips- and virus-free transplants and resistant varieties, roguing symptomatic plants, thrips monitoring and management, and area-wide sanitation is being implemented.

Given their essential role in the development of viral infection, understanding the regulation of MPs is of great importance. Here, we show that cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) MP contains three tyrosine-based sorting signals that interact with an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Î¼A-adaptin subunit. Fluorophore-tagged MP is incorporated into vesicles labeled with the endocytic tracer N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(6-(4-(diethylamino)phenyl)hexatrienyl)pyridinium dibromide. The presence of at least one of the three endocytosis motifs is essential for internalization of the protein from the plasma membrane to early endosomes, for tubule formation, and for CaMV infection. In addition, we show that MP colocalizes in vesicles with the Rab GTPase AtRAB-F2b, which is resident in prevacuolar late endosomal compartments that deliver proteins to the vacuole for degradation. Altogether, these results demonstrate that CaMV MP traffics in the endocytic pathway and that virus viability depends on functional host endomembranes.

Elucidation of the underlying developmental mechanisms of fruit diversity demands an efficient gene functional inference platform. Here, we tested the application of the tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-mediated gene-silencing system in Physalis floridana. First, we characterized the putative gene of a phytoene desaturase in P. floridana (PfPDS). Infecting the leaves of the Physalis seedlings with the PfPDS-TRV vector resulted in a bleached plant, including the developing leaves, floral organs, ICS, berry, and seed. These results indicated that a local VIGS treatment can efficiently induce a systemic mutated phenotype. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that the bleaching extent correlated to the mRNA reduction of the endogenous PfPDS. Detailed comparisons of multiple infiltration and growth protocols allowed us to determine the optimal methodologies for VIGS manipulation in Physalis. We subsequently utilized this optimized VIGS methodology to downregulate the expression of two MADS-box genes, MPF2 and MPF3, and compared the resulting effects with gene-downregulation mediated by RNA interference (RNAi) methods. The VIGS-mediated gene knockdown plants were found to resemble the mutated phenotypes of floral calyx, fruiting calyx and pollen maturation of the RNAi transgenic plants for both MPF2 and MPF3. Moreover, the two MADS-box genes were appeared to have a novel role in the pedicel development in P. floridana. The major advantage of VIGS-based gene knockdown lies in practical aspects of saving time and easy manipulation as compared to the RNAi. Despite the lack of heritability and mosaic mutation phenotypes observed in some organs, the TRV-mediated gene silencing system provides an alternative efficient way to infer gene function in various developmental processes in Physalis, thus facilitating understanding of the genetic basis of the evolution and development of the morphological diversities within the Solanaceae.

Recent studies have indicated that salicylic acid (SA) derivative methyl salicylate (MeSA) serves as a long-distance phloem-mobile systemic resistance signal in tobacco, Arabidopsis, and potato. However, other experiments indicate that jasmonic acid (JA) is a critical mobile signal. Here, we present evidence suggesting both MeSA and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) are essential for systemic resistance against Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), possibly acting as the initiating signals for systemic resistance. Foliar application of JA followed by SA triggered the strongest systemic resistance against TMV. Furthermore, we use a virus-induced gene-silencing-based genetics approach to investigate the function of JA and SA biosynthesis or signaling genes in systemic response against TMV infection. Silencing of SA or JA biosynthetic and signaling genes in Nicotiana benthamiana plants increased susceptibility to TMV. Genetic experiments also proved the irreplaceable roles of MeSA and MeJA in systemic resistance response. Systemic resistance was compromised when SA methyl transferase or JA carboxyl methyltransferase, which are required for MeSA and MeJA formation, respectively, were silenced. Moreover, high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis indicated that JA and MeJA accumulated in phloem exudates of leaves at early stages and SA and MeSA accumulated at later stages, after TMV infection. Our data also indicated that JA and MeJA could regulate MeSA and SA production. Taken together, our results demonstrate that (Me)JA and (Me)SA are required for systemic resistance response against TMV.

In this paper we report the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic properties of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in the forms of 300Ã18nm(2) rods and 54nm-sized spheres. The availability of rods and spheres made of the same protein provides a unique scaffold to study the effect of nanoparticle shape on in vivo fate. For enhanced biocompatibility, we also considered a PEGylated formulation. Overall, the versions of nanoparticles exhibited comparable in vivo profiles; a few differences were noted: data indicate that rods circulate longer than spheres, illustrating the effect that shape plays on circulation. Also, PEGylation increased circulation times. We found that macrophages in the liver and spleen cleared the TMV rods and spheres from circulation. In the spleen, the viral nanoparticles trafficked through the marginal zone before eventually co-localizing in B-cell follicles. TMV rods and spheres were cleared from the liver and spleen within days with no apparent changes in histology, it was noted that spheres are more rapidly cleared from tissues compared to rods. Further, blood biocompatibility was supported, as none of the formulations induced clotting or hemolysis. This work lays the foundation for further application and tailoring of TMV for biomedical applications.

The structure, surface chemistries and physical properties of many viruses have been well elucidated, which have allowed identification of regions of their capsids which can be modified either chemically or genetically for nanotechnological uses. In this review we focus on the use of such modifications for the functionalization and production of viruses and empty viral capsids that can be readily decorated with metals in a highly tuned manner. In particular, we discuss the use of two plant viruses (Cowpea mosaic virus and Tobacco mosaic virus) which have been extensively used for production of novel metal nanoparticles (<100nm), composites and building blocks for 2D and 3D materials, and illustrate their applications.

The SPs were uniform in shape but varied widely in size (53-800ânm), which depended on the virus concentration. Here, we describe some structural characteristics of SPs using circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the structure of SPs protein differs strongly from that of the native TMV and is characterized by coat protein subunits transition from mainly (about 50%) Î±-helical structure to a structure with low content of Î±-helices and a significant fraction of Î²-sheets. The SPs demonstrate strong reaction with thioflavin T suggesting the formation of amyloid-like structures.

However, vaccines made from recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) subunit protein are often of low potency, requiring high dose or boosting to generate a sustained immune response. We have improved the immunogenicity of a plant-made HA vaccine by chemical conjugation to the surface of the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) which is non infectious in mammals. We have previously shown that TMV is taken up by mammalian dendritic cells and is a highly effective antigen carrier. In this work, we tested several TMV-HA conjugation chemistries, and compared immunogenicity in mice as measured by anti-HA IgG titers and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI). Importantly, pre-existing immunity to TMV did not reduce initial or boosted titers. Further optimization included dosing with and without alum or oil-in water adjuvants. Surprisingly, we were able to stimulate potent immunogenicity and HAI titers with a single 15 Âµg dose of HA as a TMV conjugate. We then evaluated the efficacy of the TMV-HA vaccine in a lethal virus challenge in mice. Our results show that a single dose of the TMV-HA conjugate vaccine is sufficient to generate 50% survival, or 100% survival with adjuvant, compared with 10% survival after vaccination with a commercially available H1N1 vaccine. TMV-HA is an effective dose-sparing influenza vaccine, using a single-step process to rapidly generate large quantities of highly effective flu vaccine from an otherwise low potency HA subunit protein.",eng,2013,12,30,2014,1,1,ppublish,"Adjuvants, Immunologic|Animals|Antibodies, Viral|Disease Models, Animal|Drug Carriers|Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests|Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus|Immunoglobulin G|Influenza A virus|Influenza Vaccines|Mice, Inbred BALB C|Orthomyxoviridae Infections|Survival Analysis|Tobamovirus|Vaccination|Vaccines, Subunit|Vaccines, Synthetic",D000276|D000818|D000914|D004195|D004337|D006385|D019267|D007074|D009980|D007252|D008807|D009976|D016019|D017898|D014611|D022223|D014614,H1N1|HA subunit protein|Influenza|dose sparing|nanoparticle|plant made pharmaceuticals|vaccination

Thus, viruses may promote their own transmission by manipulating plant physiology to attract aphids and increase aphid reproduction. Consistent with this hypothesis, Myzus persicae (green peach aphids) prefer to settle on Nicotiana benthamiana infected with Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) and fecundity on virus-infected N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is higher than on uninfected controls. TuMV infection suppresses callose deposition, an important plant defense, and increases the amount of free amino acids, the major source of nitrogen for aphids. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon, 10 TuMV genes were over-expressed in plants to determine their effects on aphid reproduction. Production of a single TuMV protein, nuclear inclusion a-protease domain (NIa-Pro), increased M. persicae reproduction on both N. benthamiana and Arabidopsis. Similar to the effects that are observed during TuMV infection, NIa-Pro expression alone increased aphid arrestment, suppressed callose deposition and increased the abundance of free amino acids. Together, these results suggest a function for the TuMV NIa-Pro protein in manipulating the physiology of host plants. By attracting aphid vectors and promoting their reproduction, TuMV may influence plant-aphid interactions to promote its own transmission.",eng,2014,01,24,2014,1,1,ppublish,"Animals|Aphids|Arabidopsis|Brassica napus|Gene Expression|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Host-Parasite Interactions|Phloem|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plants, Genetically Modified|Potyvirus|Reproduction|Tobacco|Viral Proteins",D000818|D001042|D017360|D029688|D015870|D018506|D006790|D052585|D010935|D018515|D030821|D017800|D012098|D014026|D014764,Arabidopsis thaliana|Myzus persicae|Nicotiana benthamiana|Pathogen|Turnip mosaic virus|Vector|aphid|mutualism|plant defense|plant-insect interactions

Nucleic acid extracts were analyzed for detection of major freesia-infecting viruses including Freesia sneak virus (FreSV) by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with specific primer pairs. The FreSV CP gene was amplified using primer pair FreSV-F (5'-TTAGATAGTGAATCCATAAGCTGC-3') and FreSV-R (5'-ATGTCTGGAAAATACTCCGTCCAA-3'). The approximately 1.3-kb fragment of the FreSV amplified product was cloned and sequenced (GenBank Accession No. KC771891 to 98). The nucleotide sequences of CP gene of FreSV korean isolates showed 99.2 to 99.8% similarity to other FreSV isolates DQ885455, FJ807730, and GU071089, which are registered in GenBank. FreSV was detected from 71.7% of 138 plants tested while the infection rate of Freesia mosaic virus (FreMV) was 34.8%. Neither Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) nor Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) were detected from any plants tested in this study. In certain cultivars, such as 'Bluebau' (II) and 'Pretty women,' most plants planted in the field showed purple streak symptoms on the leaves. In conclusion, FreSV was detected from some symptomatic freesia cultivars showing purple streak or speckles on leaves with or without necrotic spots and necrotic speckles on leaves. FreSV is currently widespread in Korea and some freesia plants were mixed infected with FreMV. FreSV has been occurring in the Netherlands for over 40 years (2). It is a plant virus in the family Ophioviridae and Ophiovirus genus. Once it occurs in freesia plantation fields, eradication is almost impossible because FreSV is transmitted by zoospores of Olpidium brassicae, which is a soilborne root-infecting fungus (3). Resting spores of O. brassicae can remain dormant in the soil and can be infective for 20 years (1). To produce virus-free freesia plants, growers should consider whether or not their fields are contaminated with O. brassicae carrying FreSV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of FreSV in freesia plants in Korea. References: (1) R. N. Campbell. Can. J. Bot. 63:2288, 1985. (2) Y. Koot et al.

1332,25799861,Przeglad lekarski,Tobacco - a producer of recombinant interferons.,,"The approved therapeutic interferons, which are chiefly indicated for a treatment of hepatitis C or hairy cell leukaemia (IFN-Î±), relapsingl remitting sclerosis multiplex (IFN-Î²) and chronic granulomatous disease (IFN-Î³), are commercially produced by recombinant DNA technology, mainly in bacteria Escherichia coli (IFN-Î±, IFN-Î²1b, IFN-Î³), rarely in a mammalian cell line CHO (IFN-Î²la). A serum half-life time of some non-glycosylated IFN-Î± products was extended by a chemical attachment of a branched polyethylene glycol (PEG) to give PEGylated IFN-Î±. The therapy with recombinant interferons proves expensive and hence much hope is concerned with their production in other platforms assumed to be cheaper, like transgenic plants. Currently, tobacco, botanically species Nicotiana tabacum, its cultivars and some related species, especially N. benthamiana, is one of the most important plant expression systems tested for the production of therapeutical polypeptides and proteins (so-called biopharmaceuticals or biologics), especially vaccines, by using either greenhouse or field cultivated plants or cell suspension culture. IFN-Î± subtypes were expressed in tobacco nuclear genom e (IFN-Î±2a and 2b), chloroplast genome (IFN-Î±2b) and by transient expression (IFN-Î±2b). The IFÎ±-a2b chimera fusions with O-glycosylated protein with O-a-rabinogalactans expressed in tobacco BY-2 cell culture showed increased half-life time similar to that obtained by PEGylation. The production of IFN-Î±2b (non-glycosydated) in tobacco glasshouse or field cultivation has been also elaborated. One report concerned expression of IFN-Î² but with low yield. N-glycosylated IFN-Î³ could be efficiently expressed in tobacco protoplast infected with recombinant brome mosaic virus (BMV) with the yield of 5-10% of total extracted protein. This type interferon (non-glycosylated), when expressed in chloroplast genome, proved unstable and could be obtained with reasonable yield as a fusion with GUS (Î²-glucuronidase).",eng,,,,2014,1,1,ppublish,"Biopharmaceutics|Cell Culture Techniques|Genetic Engineering|Interferon-alpha|Interferon-beta|Phytochemicals|Plants, Genetically Modified|Recombinant Proteins|Species Specificity|Tobacco|Vaccines",D001702|D018929|D005818|D016898|D016899|D064209|D030821|D011994|D013045|D014026|D014612,

This result provides a mechanistic explanation for the previously reported property of TMV replication protein that it selects replication template preferentially in cis. We also found that the binding of the replication protein to the 5' UTR prevents further translation of the genomic RNA.

Here we tested this model using an experimental system that measured the efficiency with which natural polypeptide segments were inserted into the ER membrane under conditions approximating the in vivo situation, as well as in planta. Our results demonstrated that the two hydrophobic regions (HRs) of TMV MP do not span biological membranes. We further found that mutations to alter the hydrophobicity of the first HR modified membrane association and precluded virus movement.

Dynamic force spectroscopy revealed the unbinding free-energy landscapes as that at pH 4.7 the disassembly process is dominated by one free-energy barrier, whereas at pH 7.0 the process is dominated by one barrier and that there exists a second barrier. The additional free-energy barrier at longer distance has been attributed to the hindrance of disordered loops within the inner channel of TMV, and the biological function of those protein loops was discussed. The combination of pH increase and Ca(2+) concentration drop could weaken RNA-protein interactions so much that the molecular motor replisome would be able to pull and disassemble the rest of the genetic RNA from the protein coat in vivo.

1343,24324167,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Stepwise artificial evolution of a plant disease resistance gene.,10.1073/pnas.1311134110,"Genes encoding plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins confer dominant resistance to diverse pathogens. The wild-type potato NB-LRR protein Rx confers resistance against a single strain of potato virus X (PVX), whereas LRR mutants protect against both a second PVX strain and the distantly related poplar mosaic virus (PopMV). In one of the Rx mutants there was a cost to the broad-spectrum resistance because the response to PopMV was transformed from a mild disease on plants carrying wild-type Rx to a trailing necrosis that killed the plant. To explore the use of secondary mutagenesis to eliminate this cost of broad-spectrum resistance, we performed random mutagenesis of the N-terminal domains of this broad-recognition version of Rx and isolated four mutants with a stronger response against the PopMV coat protein due to enhanced activation sensitivity. These mutations are located close to the nucleotide-binding pocket, a highly conserved structure that likely controls the ""switch"" between active and inactive NB-LRR conformations. Stable transgenic plants expressing one of these versions of Rx are resistant to the strains of PVX and the PopMV that previously caused trailing necrosis. We conclude from this work that artificial evolution of NB-LRR disease resistance genes in crops can be enhanced by modification of both activation and recognition phases, to both accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative aspects of disease resistance.

The resulting rods formed dense monolayers with short range alignment on silicon substrates, substantially different from the largely wavy patterns obtained with wt TMV.

Plants protected with the heterologous construct showed an efficacy to decrease the severity of symptoms of 45%, while plants protected with the homologous construct showed an efficacy of 80%.

However, we recently demonstrated that like with Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), a satRNA associated with Cucumber Mosaic Virus strain Q (Q-satRNA) has the propensity to localize in the nucleus and generate multimers that subsequently serve as templates for HV-dependent replication. But the mechanism regulating the nuclear importation of Q-satRNA is unknown. Here we show that the nuclear importation of Q-satRNA is mediated by a bromodomain-containing host protein (BRP1), which is also apparently involved in the nuclear localization of PSTVd. A comparative analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from Nicotiana benthamiana plants coinfected with Q-satRNA and its HV confirmed the association of Q-satRNA but not HV with the nuclear compartment. A combination of the MS2-capsid protein-based RNA tagging assay and confocal microscopy demonstrated that the nuclear localization of Q-satRNA was completely blocked in transgenic lines of Nicotiana benthamiana (ph5.2nb) that are defective in BRP1 expression. This defect, however, was restored when the ph5.2nb lines of N. benthamiana were trans-complemented by ectopically expressed BRP1. The binding specificity of BRP1 with Q-satRNA was confirmed in vivo and in vitro by coimmunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, respectively. Finally, infectivity assays involving coexpression of Q-satRNA and its HV in wild-type and ph5.2nb lines of N. benthamiana accentuated a biological role for BRP1 in the Q-satRNA infection cycle. The significance of these results in relation to a possible evolutionary relationship to viroids is discussed.

In the past decade, the single-particle technique has had an important impact on the advancement of helical reconstruction. Here, we present the software package SPRING that combines Fourier based symmetry analysis and real-space helical processing into a single workflow. One of the most time-consuming steps in helical reconstruction is the determination of the initial symmetry parameters. First, we propose a class-based helical reconstruction approach that enables the simultaneous exploration and evaluation of many symmetry combinations at low resolution. Second, multiple symmetry solutions can be further assessed and refined by single-particle based helical reconstruction using the correlation of simulated and experimental power spectra. Finally, the 3D structure can be determined to high resolution. In order to validate the procedure, we use the reference specimen Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). After refinement of the helical symmetry, a total of 50,000 asymmetric units from two micrographs are sufficient to reconstruct a subnanometer 3D structure of TMV at 6.4Ã resolution. Furthermore, we introduce the individual programs of the software and discuss enhancements of the helical reconstruction workflow. Thanks to its user-friendly interface and documentation, SPRING can be utilized by the novice as well as the expert user. In addition to the study of well-ordered helical structures, the development of a streamlined workflow for single-particle based helical reconstruction opens new possibilities to analyze specimens that are heterogeneous in symmetries.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase acts as the convergent point of MAPK cascades during a variety of stress signaling. In this study, a novel MAPKK gene, ZmMKK1, in maize (Zea mays L.) belonging to group A MAPKK was isolated and functionally characterized. ZmMKK1 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and its constitutive kinase-active form ZmMKK1DD was localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus. QRT-PCR analysis uncovered that ZmMKK1 expression was triggered by abiotic and biotic stresses and exogenous signaling molecules. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Ca(2+) mediated 12Â°C-induced up-regulated expressing of ZmMKK1 at mRNA level. Ectopic expression of ZmMKK1 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) conferred tolerance to chilling stress by higher antioxidant enzyme activities, more accumulation of osmoregulatory substances and more significantly up-expression of ROS-related and stress-responsive genes compared with empty vector control plants. Furthermore, ZmMKK1 played differential functions in biotrophic versus necrotrophic pathogen-induced responses.

Moreover, ELF induced a higher increase in the levels of transcription of pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes [acidic PRs (PR-1a, PR-2, PR-3, PR-5) and basic PR-1] and defense-related enzymes [phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL, EC 4.3.1.5), and 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS, EC 2.5.1.35)] both locally and systemically, in correlation with the induction of resistance against tobacco mosaic virus.

The best-studied example of virus-induced PCD in plants is Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-elicited hypersensitive response in tobacco plants containing the N resistance gene. It was previously reported that the animal mitochondrial protein Bcl-xL, which lacks a homolog in plants, effectively suppresses plant PCD induced by TMV p50Â - the elicitor of hypersensitive response in Nicotiana tabacum carrying the N gene. Our studies show that the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 effectively suppresses p50-induced PCD in tobacco plants. On the other hand, SkQ1 did not affect Poa semilatent virus TGB3-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, which is followed by PCD, in Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells. These data suggest that mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 can be used to study molecular mechanisms of PCD suppression in plants.

Similar nucleotide interactions have been shown to occur as cross-kingdom events; for example, between plant viruses and plant micro-RNAs and also between animal viruses and animal micro-RNAs. In this study, this view is expanded to look for cross-kingdom similarities between plant virus and human micro-RNA sequences. A method to identify significant nucleotoide sequence similarities between plant viruses and hsa micro-RNAs was created. Initial analyses demonstrate that plant viruses contain nucleotide sequences which exactly match the seed sequences of human micro-RNAs in both parallel and anti-parallel directions. For example, the bean common mosaic virus strain NL4 from Colombia contains sequences that match exactly the seed sequence for micro-RNA of the hsa-mir-1226 in the parallel direction, which suggests a cross-kingdom conservation. Similarly, the rice yellow stunt viral cRNA contains a sequence that is an exact match in the anti-parallel direction to the seed sequence of hsa-micro-RNA let-7b. The functional implications of these results need to be explored. The finding of these cross-kingdom sequence similarities is a useful starting point in support of bench level investigations.

Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a key role in modulating plant responses to different biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the effect of ABA on virus infection is not fully understood. Here, we describe the effects of the ABA pathway on the accumulation of Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in two different hosts: Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. We report that ABA2 plays a critical role in the accumulation of BaMV and CMV. Mutants downstream of ABA2 (aao3, abi1-1, abi3-1, and abi4-1) were susceptible to BaMV, indicating that the ABA pathway downstream of ABA2 is essential for BaMV resistance. The aba2-1 mutant decreased the accumulation of BaMV (+)RNA, (-)RNA, and coat protein, with the most dramatic effect being observed for (-)RNA. These findings were further validated by the use of virus-induced gene silencing and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in N. benthamiana. In addition, infecting N. benthamiana with BaMV or CMV increased ABA contents and activated the SA and ABA pathways, thereby disrupting the antagonism between these two cascades. Our findings uncover a novel role for ABA2 in supporting BaMV and CMV accumulation, distinct from the opposing role of its downstream genes.

No significant difference was observed in BaMV accumulation in the NbRabGAP1-knockdown and the control protoplasts. However, BaMV accumulation was 50% and 2% in the inoculated and systemic leaves, respectively, of the knockdown plants to those of the control plants. By measuring the spreading area of BaMV infection foci in the inoculated leaves, we found that BaMV moved less efficiently in the NbRabGAP1-knockdown plants than in the control plants.

The disease spread and symptom severity in several cultivars (Medeo, Calvados, and Pink Fountain) led to nearly complete production failure for some growers. Initial symptoms consisted of scattered pale, chlorotic, interveinal lesions that coalesced. Later, irregular brown to black necrotic blotches partially covered the leaves. Flower break was also observed. Diseased plants were collected in late April 2012 from one of the surveyed greenhouses, where >90% of Medeo (white-flowered) and 35 to 40% of Pink Fountain (pink) plants were symptomatic. Total RNA was extracted from three pooled samples of ~10 plants each and analyzed for Freesia sneak virus (3) (FreSV, Ophiovirus, Ophioviridae) infection by RT-PCR. A generic Ophiovirus RT-PCR (4) yielded the diagnostic 136-bp product, while primers FOV1 (TGCTCGAATAGCCGGAACTGAA) and FOV2 (TGCTTCCAGGTGTAAGATGGCA), designed from the Italian FreSV coat protein gene (RNA3; GenBank DQ885455), specifically amplified a 466 bp fragment. This FreSV-specific fragment was amplified from all samples, pooled, purified, and subjected to direct sequencing using the same primers. The deduced amino acid sequence had 99.8% identity to that of DQ885455, confirming FreSV infection in the symptomatic Bulgarian freesias. FreSV RNA3 (about 1.5 kbp) was also detected by northern blotting using a specific Digoxigenin-DNA probe (PCR-DIG Probe Synthesis Kit, Roche) amplified with primers FOV1/2. Due to severe symptoms present on freesias, a mixed infection was suspected. Several other viruses have been reported to infect cultivated freesia (1), so diagnostic primers for Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV, Cucumovirus, Bromoviridae), Tobacco rattle virus (TRV, Tobravirus, Virgaviridae), and Potyvirus genus (4) were used in RT-PCR assays with random-primed cDNA from infected freesias as the template. No CMV or TRV PCR products were detected; a generic potyvirus PCR product was identified as Freesia mosaic virus (FreMV, Potyvirus, Potyviridae) by sequencing of five independent clones. Severe leaf necrosis syndrome was described in freesia in The Netherlands before 1970, as well as in England and Germany; FreSV is a putative agent of freesia leaf necrosis, being reported in strong association with the disease in Italy, The Netherlands, the United States, and New Zealand, and also infects Lachenalia hyb. (Hyacinthaceae) (2,3,4). However, additional unidentified synergistic viral agents cannot be ruled out and must be identified to aid control of soilborne severe leaf necrosis syndrome. The vector of FreSV, Olpidium brassicae, may persist in soil for years (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of FreSV on F. refracta in Bulgaria; identifying the disease and vector may allow growers to implement preventive control measures to reduce economic damage.

Previously, we identified that the chloroplast phosphoglycerate kinase (chl-PGK) from Nicotiana benthamiana is one of the viral RNA binding proteins involved in the BaMV infection cycle. Because chl-PGK is transported to the chloroplast, we hypothesized that chl-PGK might be involved in viral RNA localization in the chloroplasts. To test this hypothesis, we constructed two green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused mislocalized PGK mutants, the transit peptide deletion mutant (NO TRANSIT PEPTIDE [NOTP]-PGK-GFP) and the nucleus location mutant (nuclear location signal [NLS]-PGK-GFP). Using confocal microscopy, we demonstrated that NOTP-PGK-GFP and NLS-PGK-GFP are localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, in N. benthamiana plants. When NOTP-PGK-GFP and NLS-PGK-GFP are transiently expressed, we observed a reduction in BaMV coat protein accumulation to 47% and 27% that of the wild-type PGK-GFP, respectively. To localize viral RNA in infected cells, we employed the interaction of NLS-GFP-MS2 (phage MS2 coat protein) with the modified BaMV RNA containing the MS2 coat protein binding sequence. Using confocal microscopy, we observed that BaMV viral RNA localizes to chloroplasts. Furthermore, elongation factor1a fused with the transit peptide derived from chl-PGK or with a Rubisco small subunit can partially restore BaMV accumulation in NbPGK1-knockdown plants by helping BaMV target chloroplasts.

Critical factors for a successful tobamovirus infection are the viral movement protein (MP) and the host pectin methylesterase (PME), an important plant counterpart that cooperates with MP to sustain viral spread. The activity of PME is modulated by endogenous protein inhibitors (pectin methylesterase inhibitors, PMEIs). PMEIs are targeted to the extracellular matrix and typically inhibit plant PMEs by forming a specific and stable stoichiometric 1:1 complex. PMEIs counteract the action of plant PMEs and therefore may affect plant susceptibility to virus. To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed genes encoding two well-characterized PMEIs in tobacco and Arabidopsis plants. Here, we report that, in tobacco plants constitutively expressing a PMEI from Actinidia chinensis (AcPMEI), systemic movement of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is limited and viral symptoms are reduced. A delayed movement of Turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV) and a reduced susceptibility to the virus were also observed in Arabidopsis plants overexpressing AtPMEI-2. Our results provide evidence that PMEIs are able to limit tobamovirus movement and to reduce plant susceptibility to the virus.

Previous studies have shown that C2 protein of BYVMV acts as a suppressor of post transcriptional gene silencing, activates transcription, localizes to nucleus, and interacts with karyopherin Î±. To probe the role of C2 in symptom determination and virus replication, the infectious clones of BYVMV containing two stop codons in the C2 ORF were created and used for infection studies. The Nicotiana benthamiana plants infiltrated with the infectious clones harboring stop codons in the C2 ORF did not develop any symptoms unlike plants infiltrated with wild-type BYVMV. Southern blotting and real time PCR analysis revealed that the viral load was reduced drastically in the plants infected with BYVMV containing the nontranslatable version of C2 ORF. However, there was a recovery in viral DNA replication, when co-infiltrated with wild-type betasatellite. Hence we conclude that the C2 protein of BYVMV plays an important role in symptom determination and viral DNA replication.",eng,,,,2013,10,15,ppublish,"Begomovirus|Codon, Nonsense|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Mutant Proteins|Plant Diseases|Tobacco|Viral Proteins|Virus Replication",D053839|D018389|D054884|D050505|D010935|D014026|D014764|D014779,

The SPs represent a universal platform that could bind various proteins. Here, we report that entire isometric virions of heterogeneous nature bind non-specifically to the SPs. Formaldehyde (FA) was used for covalent binding of a virus to the SPs surface for stabilizing the SP-virus complexes. Transmission and high resolution scanning electron microscopy showed that the SPs surface was covered with virus particles. The architecture of SP-virion complexes was examined by immunologic methods. Mean diameters of SPs and SP-human enterovirus C and SP-cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) compositions were determined by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) in liquid. Significantly, neither free SPs nor individual virions were detected by NTA in either FA-crosslinked or FA-untreated compositions. Entirely, all virions were bound to the SPs surface and the SP sites within the SP-CaMV complexes were inaccessible for anti-SP antibodies. Likewise, the SPs immunogenicity within the FA-treated SPs-CaMV compositions was negligible. Apparently, the SP antigenic sites were hidden and masked by virions within the compositions. Previously, we reported that the SPs exhibited adjuvant activity when foreign proteins/epitopes were mixed with or crosslinked to SPs. We found that immunogenicity of entire CaMV crosslinked to SP was rather low which could be due to the above-mentioned masking of the SPs booster. Contrastingly, immunogenicity of the FA-untreated compositions increased significantly, presumably, due to partial release of virions and unmasking of some SPs-buster sites after animals immunization.

RDR1 expression can be elicited by viral infection and salicylic acid (SA), but the mechanisms of signaling during this process remains undefined. The involvement of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) in RDR1 induction in the compatible interactions between Tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV) and Nicotiana tabacum, Nicotiana benthamiana, and Arabidopsis thaliana was examined. TMV inoculation onto the lower leaves of N. tabacum induced the rapid accumulation of H2O2 and NO followed by the increased accumulation of RDR1 transcripts in the non-inoculated upper leaves. Pretreatment with exogenous H2O2 and NO on upper leaf led to increased RDR1 expression and systemic TMV resistance. Conversely, dimethylthiourea (an H2O2 scavenger) and 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)- 4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (an NO scavenger) partly blocked TMV- and SA-induced RDR1 expression and increased TMV susceptibility, whereas pretreatment with exogenous H2O2 and NO failed to diminish TMV infection in N. benthamiana plants with naturally occurring RDR1 loss-of-function. Furthermore, in N. tabacum and A. thaliana, TMV-induced H2O2 accumulation was NO-dependent, whereas NO generation was not affected by H2O2. These results suggest that, in response to TMV infection, H2O2 acts downstream of NO to mediate induction of RDR1, which plays a critical role in strengthening RNA silencing to restrict systemic viral infection.

To discriminate between primary infections and secondary infections associated with the virus intercellular movement, a gene cassette expressing GFP-HDEL was inserted adjacent to a TuMV infectious cassette expressing 6Kâ:mCherry, both within the T-DNA borders of the binary vector pCambia. In this system, both gene cassettes were delivered to the same cell by a single binary vector and primary infection foci emitted green and red fluorescence while secondarily infected cells emitted only red fluorescence. Intercellular movement was measured at 72 hours post infiltration and was estimated to proceed at an average rate of one cell being infected every three hours over an observation period of 17 hours. To determine if the secretory pathway were important for TuMV intercellular movement, chemical and protein inhibitors that blocked both early and late secretory pathways were used. Treatment with Brefeldin A or Concanamycin A or expression of ARF1 or RAB-E1d dominant negative mutants, all of which inhibit pre- or post-Golgi transport, reduced intercellular movement by the virus. These treatments, however, did not inhibit virus replication in primary infected cells. Pharmacological interference assays using Tyrphostin A23 or Wortmannin showed that endocytosis was not important for TuMV intercellular movement. Lack of co-localization by endocytosed FM4-64 and Ara7 (AtRabF2b) with TuMV-induced 6Kâ-tagged vesicles further supported this conclusion. Microfilament depolymerizing drugs and silencing expression of myosin XI-2 gene, but not myosin VIII genes, also inhibited TuMV intercellular movement. Expression of dominant negative myosin mutants confirmed the role played by myosin XI-2 as well as by myosin XI-K in TuMV intercellular movement. Using this dual gene cassette expression system and transport inhibitors, components of the secretory and actomyosin machinery were shown to be important for TuMV intercellular spread.",eng,2013,10,03,2013,10,8,ppublish,"ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1|Actin Cytoskeleton|Androstadienes|Antifungal Agents|Antiviral Agents|Biological Transport, Active|Brefeldin A|Endocytosis|Enzyme Inhibitors|Macrolides|Myosins|Plant Proteins|Tobacco|Tymovirus|Tyrphostins|Virus Replication|Wortmannin",D020823|D008841|D000730|D000935|D000998|D001693|D020126|D004705|D004791|D018942|D009218|D010940|D014026|D017806|D020032|D014779|D000077191,

Copper is one of the essential microelements and is readily taken up by plants. However, to date, it has rarely been used to control the expression of genes of interest, probably due to the inefficiency of the gene expression systems. In this study, we successfully developed a copper-inducible gene expression system that is based on the regulation of the yeast metallothionein gene. This system can be applied in the field and regulated at approximately one-hundredth of the rate used for registered copper-based fungicides. In the presence of copper, a translational fusion of the ACE1 transcription factor with the VP16 activation domain (VP16AD) of herpes simplex virus strongly activated transcription of the GFP gene in transgenic Arabidopsis. Interestingly, insertion of the To71 sequence, a 5'-untranslated region of the 130k/180k gene of tomato mosaic virus, upstream of the GFP gene reduced the basal expression of GFP in the absence of copper to almost negligible levels, even in soil-grown plants that were supplemented with ordinary liquid nutrients. Exposure of plants to 100 Î¼M copper resulted in an over 1,000-fold induction ratio at the transcriptional level of GFP. This induction was copper-specific and dose-dependent with rapid and reversible responses. Using this expression system, we also succeeded in regulating floral transition by copper treatment.

Symptoms on affected plants included apical leaf curling and stunting, overall chlorosis and plant stunting, young plant deformation with cabbage-like leaves, wilting, and internal vascular necrosis of stems and leaf petioles. All cultivars grown were affected, with disease incidence ranging from 5 to 80% of symptomatic plants per field. The fields were also heavily infested with the psyllid Bactericera cockerelli. This psyllid is a serious pest of solanaceous crops in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and New Zealand and has been shown to transmit the bacterium ""Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum"" to potato, tomato, and other solanaceous species (2,3). Tobacco (cv. Habano criollo) plant samples were collected from one field in the municipality of Trojes. Initial testing of the plant samples for viruses, including Tobacco mosaic virus, Impatiens necrotic spot virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, and Potato virus Y, using Immunostrips (Agdia, Elkhart, IN) were negative. Total DNA was then extracted from leaf tissues of a total of 13 plants, including eight symptomatic plants and five asymptomatic plants with the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer extraction method (2,4). The DNA samples were tested by PCR using specific PCR primer pairs OA2/OI2c and OMB 1482f/2086r, to amplify a portion of 16S rDNA and the outer membrane protein (OMB) gene of ""Ca. L. solanacearum,"" respectively (2). All eight (100%) symptomatic plant samples were positive for ""Ca. L. solanacearum"" with both sets of primer pairs. ""Ca. L. solanacearum"" was not detected in the asymptomatic plants. The 16S rDNA and OMB gene amplicons of two plant samples each were cloned and four clones of each of the four amplicons were sequenced. BLASTn analysis of the consensus sequences confirmed ""Ca. L. solanaeacrum"" in the tobacco samples. The 16S rDNA consensus sequences (1,168 bp) of all amplicons were identical and showed 100% identity with several 16S rDNA sequences of ""Ca. L. solanacearum"" in GenBank (e.g., Accession Nos.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of ""Ca. L. solanacearum"" associated with tobacco in Honduras, where this cash crop is economically important. This bacterium has also caused millions of dollars in losses to potato, tomato, and several other solanaceous crops in North and Central America and New Zealand, particularly in regions where B. cockerelli is present (3).

Hayek) producers in the world. Cultivation of this crop is done mainly in the Aegean and Eastern Marmara regions with asexually propagated cultivars such as Bayrampasa and Sakiz. More than half of total globe artichoke production in Turkey is obtained from the provinces of Izmir, Aydin, and Mugla in the Aegean region. Surveys in 2011 and 2012 were carried out to look for the presence of Artichoke yellow ringspot virus (AYRSV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) in the globe artichoke production areas in these three provinces. Double antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA and reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR assays conducted for TMV and TSWV showed that the samples were not infected with these two viruses. Due to the lack of commercial ELISA kits against AYRSV, RT-PCR and biological indexing were used for its identification. Leaf tissues from 35 symptomatic and 25 symptomless plants were sampled and analyzed by RT-PCR using as template total RNAs extracted by a silica gel method (1). RT-PCR was conducted as previously reported (1). A PCR product of the expected size (about 530 bp) was obtained from five plant samples that were collected from Izmir province and had symptoms of bright yellow spots and line patterns on the leaves. The incidence of diseased plants in the fields ranged from 1 to 5%. In previously conducted studies, these symptoms were defined as typical symptoms of AYRSV on artichokes (2,3,4). One of the PCR products was cloned and sequenced. BLASTn analysis of the obtained sequence (GenBank Accession No. KC622054) showed 92% nucleotide identity with the partial RNA1 sequence of an AYRSV isolate from Allium cepa (AM087671.2). Furthermore, selected test plants were mechanically inoculated with sap from plant samples that were positive in RT-PCR. Chlorotic local lesions and systemic mottling symptoms were observed on Chenopodium quinoa; chlorotic lesions, mosaic, and deformation on Cucumis sativus; and systemic mosaic, reddish necrotic local lesions, and malformation on Phaseolus vulgaris (French bean). Results of the biological tests were confirmed by RT-PCR. AYRSV has a wide host range including artichoke and six other cultivated plant species and can be easily transmitted by seed, plant sap, and vegetative propagation (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of natural infection of globe artichoke by AYRSV in Turkey. AYRSV infections can have a detrimental effect on the growth and yield of artichoke plantings.

1390,30722152,Plant disease,Araujia sericifera New Host of Alfalfa mosaic virus in Italy.,10.1094/PDIS-03-13-0300-PDN,"Araujia sericifera Brot. (Fam. Apocynaceae) is an evergreen climbing plant native of South America, originally introduced in Europe as an ornamental. In spring 2012, virus-like symptoms including bright yellow mosaic of calico-type and leaf distortion were observed in three A. sericifera plants growing in an abandoned field located in Pomigliano d'Arco (Campania region, Italy). Leaves from the three plants were collected and examined using commercial antisera (Bioreba AG, Reinach, Switzerland) by double antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA against Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), and by indirect plate trapped antigen (PTA)-ELISA against potyviruses (Potygroup test). Only AMV was detected serologically in the three A. sericifera samples. The virus was mechanically transmitted from the ELISA-positive samples to four plants each of Chenopodium quinoa, C. amaranticolor, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi nc), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata, cv. Black eyes), basil (Ocimum basilicum, cv. Gigante), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. San Marzano), using chilled 0.03 M sodium phosphate buffer, containing 0.2% sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, 75 mg/ml of active charcoal, and traces of Carborundum (600 mesh). Inoculated plants were kept in an insect-proof greenhouse with natural illumination and temperatures of 24 and 18Â°C day/night. Under these conditions, plants showed the following symptoms after 1 to 3 weeks, consistent with symptoms caused by AMV (1): chlorotic local lesions following by mosaic in C. quinoa and C. amaranticolor, reddish local lesions following by mosaic in cowpea, necrotic local lesions followed by systemic necrosis in tomato, bright yellow mosaic (calico type) in basil, and mosaic and strong deformation of the apical leaves in tobacco. The presence of AMV in ELISA-positive A. sericifera and host plants was further confirmed by conventional reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Total RNAs were extracted with an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RT-PCR was performed with the One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) using primers for the coat protein gene (CP) previously used for the molecular characterization of AMV isolates (2). An Italian isolate of AMV from Lavandula stoechas (GenBank Accession No. FN667967) and RNA extracted from a healthy A. sericifera plant were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. An amplicon of the correct predicted size (â¼750 bp) was obtained from each of the infected plants assayed, and that derived from A. sericifera isolate Ars2 was purified (QIAqick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen), cloned in pGEMT easy vector (Promega, Fitchburg, WI) and sequenced (HF570950). Sequence analysis of the CP gene, conducted with MEGA5 software, revealed the highest nucleotide identity of 98% (99% amino acid identity) with the AMV isolate Tef-1 (FR854391), an isolate belonging to subgroup I (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of AMV infecting A. sericifera in Italy. Since A. sericifera is considered an invasive plant, in continuous expansion to new areas in Italy and in other European countries, particular attention should be paid to the possibility that this species may play a role in the epidemiology of aphid-transmitted viruses such as AMV and CMV, representing a threat to susceptible crops growing nearby.

Hannah, propagated by rooted stem cuttings and cultivated for commercial purposes in a greenhouse located at Albenga (Liguria region, Italy), were noticed for a rapid dieback, generalized reddening, following by an irreversible wilting. Around 130 plants on a total of 3,000 cultivated plants showed symptoms (4 to 5%). One gram of fresh leaves, each collected from three different symptomatic plants, was ground in 4 ml of cold (â¼5Â°C) sodium phosphate 0.03 M buffer, containing 0.2% sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, 75 mg/ml of active charcoal, and traces of carborundum (600 mesh). The inoculum was rubbed on healthy indicator herbaceous plants and inoculated plants were maintained in an insect-proof greenhouse with natural illumination and temperatures of 24/18Â°C day/night. Healthy and buffer inoculated plants were also included in the test and used as negative control in the subsequent serological and molecular analysis. Sap-inoculated plants showed the following symptoms after 1 to 3 weeks: necrotic local lesions in Chenopodium amaranticolor and C. quinoa, yellowing and stunting following by systemic necrosis and death of the plants in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv. San Marzano), necrotic local lesions following by systemic necrotic patterns and leaf deformation in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi nc.) and N. glutinosa, necrotic local lesions in petunia (Petunia Ã hybrida cv. Pink Beauty). No symptoms were recorded on buffer inoculated plants. Leaf samples from both symptomatic hosts and the three original symptomatic African daisy plants were tested by double-antibody sandwich-ELISA with polyclonal antisera against Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and tospoviruses (Tospovirus broad-spectrum, Serogroups I, II, and III, Bioreba AG, Switzerland). Positive reaction was obtained with Tospo-groups antibodies, but not with the CMV ones. Total RNA was extracted from infected leaves of African daisy with the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and subjected to reverse transcription (RT)-PCR by using the tospovirus universal primers BR60/BR65 that amplify part of the nucleocapsid protein gene (1). Target amplicons of 454 bp were produced for all samples tested. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced on both strands (one clone per amplicon cloned). The resulting sequences were 100% identical, so a single sequence was deposited in GenBank (HF913777). The sequence showed highest homology (99%) with the Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) tomato isolate NJ-JN from South Korea (HM581936). The identity of the virus infecting African daisy was further confirmed by sequencing amplicons obtained by RT-PCR using primers partially covering the movement protein gene of TSWV (2). The sequence obtained (HF913776) showed the highest homology (99%) with three TSWV isolates: a tomato isolate from Spain (AY744493), a pepper isolate from South Korea (AB663306), and again the tomato NJ-JN isolate from South Korea (HM581936). To our knowledge, this is the first natural report of TSWV infecting African daisy plants. Moreover, since this ornamental is often cultivated with other flowering plants, it can act as reservoir for the virus that can infect other ornamentals and crops, considering that TSWV has a very broad host range (3). This result also represents the first finding of TSWV in the genus Arctotis, family Asteraceae, the greater botanical family of TSWV hosts (3). References: (1) M. Eiras et al. Fitopatol.

Since the turn of the century, there has been a concerted effort to develop sensitive tests for many of the previously uncharacterized, graft-transmissible agents infecting strawberry. These tests were employed to determine the presence of strawberry viruses in major strawberry production and nursery areas of North America. The viruses evaluated in this study were Apple mosaic, Beet pseudo-yellows, Fragaria chiloensis latent, Strawberry chlorotic fleck, Strawberry crinkle, Strawberry latent ring spot, Strawberry mild yellow edge, Strawberry mottle, Strawberry necrotic shock, Strawberry pallidosis, Strawberry vein banding, and Tobacco streak. The aphid-borne viruses were predominant in the Pacific Northwest whereas the whitefly-borne viruses were prevalent in California, the Midwest, and the Southeast. In the Northeast, the aphid-transmitted Strawberry mottle and Strawberry mild yellow edge viruses along with the whitefly-transmitted viruses were most common. The incidence of pollen-borne viruses was low in most areas, with Strawberry necrotic shock being the most prevalent virus of this group. These results indicate that there are hotspots for individual virus groups that normally coincide with the presence of the vectors. The information presented highlights the high-risk viruses for nursery production, where efforts are made to control all viruses, and fruit production, where efforts are made to control virus diseases.",eng,,,,2013,10,1,ppublish,,,
1393,24071744,Plant & cell physiology,Jasmonic acid negatively regulates resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus in tobacco.,10.1093/pcp/pct137,"Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) cultivars possessing the N resistance gene to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) induce a hypersensitive response, which is accompanied by the production of phytohormones such as salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), to enclose the invaded virus at the initial site of infection, which inhibits viral multiplication and spread. SA functions as a positive regulator of TMV resistance. However, the role of JA in TMV resistance has not been fully elucidated. Exogenously applied methyl jasmonate, a methyl ester of JA, reduced local resistance to TMV and permitted systemic viral movement. Furthermore, in contrast to a previous finding, we demonstrated that silencing of CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1), a JA receptor, reduced viral accumulation in a tobacco cultivar possessing the N gene, as did that of allene oxide synthase, a JA biosynthetic enzyme. The reduction in viral accumulation in COI1-silenced tobacco plants was correlated with an increase in SA, and lowering SA levels by introducing an SA hydroxylase gene attenuated this reduction. Viral susceptibility did not change in a COI1-silenced tobacco cultivar lacking the N gene. These results suggest that JA signaling is not directly responsible for susceptibility to TMV, but is indirectly responsible for viral resistance through the partial inhibition of SA-mediated resistance conferred by the N gene, and that a balance between endogenous JA and SA levels is important for determining the degree of resistance.",eng,2013,09,25,2013,9,28,ppublish,"Cyclopentanes|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Gene Silencing|Oxylipins|Plant Proteins|Plants, Genetically Modified|Signal Transduction|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D003517|D018506|D020868|D054883|D010940|D030821|D015398|D014026|D014027,Disease resistance|Jasmonic acid|Salicylic acid|Tobacco mosaic virus

We compared the transient activity of the MUASMSCP promoter in tobacco/Arabidopsis protoplasts and in whole plant (Petunia hybrida) with the same that obtained from CaMV35S and MUAS35SCP promoters individually. The MUASMSCP promoter showed 1.1 and 1.5 times stronger GUS-activities over that obtained from MUAS35SCP and CaMV35S promoters respectively, in tobacco (Xanthi Brad) protoplasts. In transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, var. Samsun NN), the MUASMSCP promoter showed 1.1 and 2.2 times stronger activities than MUAS35SCP and CaMV35S(2) promoters respectively. We observed a fair correlation between MUASMSCP-, MUAS35SCP- and CaMV35S(2)-driven GUS activities with the corresponding uidA-mRNA level in transgenic plants. X-gluc staining of transgenic germinating seed-sections and whole seedlings also support above findings. Protein-extracts made from tobacco protoplasts expressing GFP and human-IL-24 genes driven individually by the MUASMSCP promoter showed enhanced expression of the reporters compared to that obtained from the CaMV35S promoter. Furthermore, MUASMSCP-driven protoplast-derived human IL-24 showed enhanced cell inhibitory activity in DU-145 prostate cancer cells compared to that obtained from the CaMV35S promoter. We propose chimeric MUASMSCP promoter developed in the study could be useful for strong constitutive expression of transgenes in both plant/animal cells and it may become an efficient substitute for CaMV35S/CaMV35S(2) promoter.

1396,24056758,Nanoscale,Nanoscale structural features determined by AFM for single virus particles.,10.1039/c3nr02706f,"In this work, we propose ""single-image analysis"", as opposed to multi-image averaging, for extracting valuable information from AFM images of single bio-particles. This approach allows us to study molecular systems imaged by AFM under general circumstances without restrictions on their structural forms. As feature exhibition is a resolution correlation, we have performed AFM imaging on surfaces of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) to demonstrate variations of structural patterns with probing resolution. Two AFM images were acquired with the same tip at different probing resolutions in terms of pixel width, i.e., 1.95 and 0.49 nm per pixel. For assessment, we have constructed an in silico topograph based on the three-dimensional crystal structure of TMV as a reference. The prominent artifacts observed in the AFM-determined shape of TMV were attributed to tip convolutions. The width of TMV rod was systematically overestimated by ~10 nm at both probing resolutions of AFM. Nevertheless, the effects of tip convolution were less severe in vertical orientation so that the estimated height of TMV by AFM imaging was in close agreement with the in silico X-ray topograph. Using dedicated image processing algorithms, we found that at low resolution (i.e., 1.95 nm per pixel), the extracted surface features of TMV can be interpreted as a partial or full helical repeat (three complete turns with ~7.0 nm in length), while individual protein subunits (~2.5 nm) were perceivable only at high resolution. The present study shows that the scales of revealed structural features in AFM images are subject to both probing resolution and processing algorithms for image analysis.",eng,2013,09,09,2013,9,24,ppublish,"Algorithms|Microscopy, Atomic Force|Nanostructures|Surface Properties|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Virion",D000465|D018625|D049329|D013499|D014027|D014771,

Better strategies for managing this pest are greatly needed. RNA interference (RNAi) is an emerging tool for functional genomics studies and is being investigated as a practical tool for highly targeted insect control. Here we investigated whether RNAi effects can be induced in P. citri and whether candidate mRNAs could be identified as possible targets for RNAi-based P. citri control. RNAi effects were induced in P. citri, as demonstrated by specific target reductions of P. citri actin, chitin synthase 1 and V-ATPase mRNAs after injection of the corresponding specific double-stranded RNA inducers. We also used recombinant Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) to express these RNAi effectors in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. We found that P. citri showed lower fecundity and pronounced death of crawlers after feeding on recombinant TMV-infected plants. Taken together, our data show that actin, chitin synthase 1 and V-ATPase mRNAs are potential targets for RNAi against P. citri, and that recombinant TMV is an effective tool for evaluating candidate RNAi effectors in plants.

Sequencing of the viral RNAs revealed recombination events in the 3' untranslated region of RNA1 of BMV purified from barley and wheat, but not from tobacco. However, the relative amounts of the BMV RNAs that accumulated in barley and wheat are similar and RNA accumulation is not sufficient to account for the difference in RNA encapsidation. Virions purified from barley and wheat were found to differ in their isoelectric points, resistance to proteolysis, and contacts between the capsid residues and the RNA. Mass spectrometric analyses revealed that virions from the three hosts had different post-translational modifications that should impact the physiochemical properties of the virions. Another major source of variation in RNA encapsidation was due to the purification of BMV particles to homogeneity. Highly enriched BMV present in lysates had a surprising range of sizes, buoyant densities, and distinct relative amounts of encapsidated RNAs. These results show that the encapsidated BMV RNAs reflect a combination of host effects on the physiochemical properties of the viral capsids and the enrichment of a subset of virions. The previously unexpected heterogeneity in BMV should influence the timing of the infection and also the host innate immune responses.

Experimental data show that the presence of the cap structure at the 5' end of a nucleic acid is an important condition for vRNP assembly from RNA and CP.

1403,24023899,PloS one,Profiling of genes related to cross protection and competition for NbTOM1 by HLSV and TMV.,10.1371/journal.pone.0073725,"Cross protection is the phenomenon through which a mild strain virus suppresses symptoms induced by a closely related severe strain virus in infected plants. Hibiscus latent Singapore virus (HLSV) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) are species within the genus tobamovirus. HLSV can protect Nicotianabenthamiana against TMV-U1 strain, resulting in mild symptoms instead of severe systemic necrosis. The mechanism of cross protection between HLSV and TMV is unknown. In the past, some researchers suggest that the protecting virus strain might occupy virus-specific replication sites within a cell leaving no room for the challenge virus. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed to detect viral RNA levels during cross protection. HLSV accumulation increased in cross protected plants compared with that of single HLSV infected plants, while TMV decreased in cross protected plants. This suggests that there is a competition for host factors between HLSV and TMV for replication. To investigate the mechanism under the cross protection between HLSV and TMV, microarray analysis was conducted to examine the transcriptional levels of global host genes during cross protection, using Tobacco Gene Expression Microarray, 4 x 44 k slides. The transcriptional level of some host genes corresponded to accumulation level of TMV. Some host genes were up-regulated only by HLSV. Tobamovirus multiplication gene 1 (TOM1), essential for tobamovirus multiplication, was involved in competition for replication by HLSV and TMV during cross protection. Both HLSV and TMV accumulation decreased when NbTOM1 was silenced. A large quantity of HLSV resulted in decreased TMV accumulation in HLSV+TMV (100:1) co-infection. These results indicate that host genes involved in the plant defense response and virus multiplication are up-regulated by challenge virus TMV but not by protecting virus HLSV during cross protection.",eng,2013,09,04,2013,9,12,epublish,Cross Reactions|Gene Expression Profiling|Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis|Plant Diseases|Plant Proteins|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Virus Replication,D003429|D020869|D020411|D010935|D010940|D014026|D014027|D014779,

The properties of 1D NPs, such as stiffness and aspect ratio, play a critical role in the alignment. Furthermore, these hierarchically organized structures can be used to support cell growth and control the cell orientation and morphology. When C2C12 myoblasts were cultured on surfaces coated with aligned TMV, we found that nanoscale topographic features were critical to guide the cell orientation and myogenic differentiation.

The scientific importance of the vegetable results from the fact that the genome of S. lycopersicum has been sequenced. This allows researchers to study fundamental mechanisms playing an essential role during tomato development and response to environmental factors contributing significantly to cell metabolism alterations. Parallel with the development of contemporary genetics and the constant increase in sequencing data, progress has to be aligned with improvement of experimental methods used for studying genes functions and gene expression levels, of which the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is still the most reliable. As well as with other nucleic acid-based methods used for comparison of the abundance of specific RNAs, the RT-qPCR data have to be normalised to the levels of RNAs represented stably in a cell. To achieve the goal, the so-called housekeeping genes (i.e., RNAs encoding, for instance, proteins playing an important role in the cell metabolism or structure maintenance), are used for normalisation of the target gene expression data. However, a number of studies have indicated the transcriptional instability of commonly used reference genes analysed in different situations or conditions; for instance, the origin of cells, tissue types, or environmental or other experimental conditions. The expression of ten common housekeeping genes of S. lycopersicum, namely EF1Î±, TUB, CAC, EXP, RPL8, GAPDH, TBP, ACT, SAND and 18S rRNA were examined during viral infections of tomato. Changes in the expression levels of the genes were estimated by comparison of the non-inoculated tomato plants with those infected with commonly known tomato viral pathogens, Tomato torrado virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, Tobacco mosaic virus and Pepino mosaic virus, inducing a diverse range of disease symptoms on the common host, ranging from mild leaves chlorosis to very severe stem necrosis. It is emphasised that despite the wide range of diverse disease symptoms it is concluded that ACT, CAC and EF1Î± could be used as the most suitable reference genes in studies of host-virus interactions in tomato.

Heavy infestations of the psyllid Bactericera cockerelli, a major insect pest of potato and other solanaceous crops and vector of the bacterium ""Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum"" (Lso) (2,3), were observed in the affected fields. All cultivars grown were affected and 5 to 100% of plants in each field were symptomatic. Symptoms on affected plants included apical leaf curling and stunting, overall chlorosis and plant stunting, young plant deformation with cabbage-like leaves, wilting, internal vascular necrosis of stems and leaf petioles, and overall poor leaf quality. Plant samples were collected from a total of three psyllid-infested fields in the municipalities of Esteli, Condega, and Jalapa (one field/municipality). The plant samples were first tested for viruses, including Potato virus Y, Tobacco mosaic virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, and Impatiens necrotic spot virus, using Immunostrips (Agdia, Elkhart, IN) and no virus was detected. Total DNA was extracted from leaf tissues of a total of 22 plants, including 17 symptomatic plants and five asymptomatic plants from two cultivars (Corojo and Habano) with the cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer extraction method (2,4). The DNA samples were tested by PCR using specific primer pairs OA2/OI2c and OMB 1482f/2086r, to amplify a portion of 16S rDNA and the outer membrane protein (OMB) genes, respectively, of Lso (2). 16 rDNA and OMB gene-derived fragments of 1,168 and 605 bp, respectively, were amplified from the DNA of 13 of 17 (76.5%) symptomatic plants, indicating the presence of Lso. No Lso was detected in the five asymptomatic plants. DNA amplicons of three plant samples (one plant/field) with each primer pair were cloned and two to four clones of each of the six amplicons were sequenced. BLASTn analysis of the 16S rDNA consensus sequences was the same for all three locations (GenBank Accession Nos. KC768323, KC768324, and KC768325) and showed 100% identity to numerous 16 rDNA sequences of Lso in GenBank, including accessions HM245242, JF811596, and JX559779. Similarly, identical OMB consensus sequences were observed in all three locations (KC768331 and KC768332 for Jalapa and Condega, respectively) that are 97 to 100% identical to a number of Lso sequences in GenBank (e.g., CP002371, FJ914617, JN848754, and JN848752). A second OMB sequence was isolated from the Esteli sample (KC768333) that was 98% identical with the consensus sequences from this and other sites and 100% identical to an OMB sequence from Lso in GenBank (JN848754). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Lso associated with tobacco. Tobacco is an important crop in many parts of the world, including Central and South America. This bacterium has also caused millions of dollars in losses to potato and several other solanaceous crops in the Americas and New Zealand (3). In addition, this plant pathogen has been reported as serious pest of carrot in Europe, where it is associated with the psyllids Trioza apicalis and B. trigonica (1,4). References: (1) A.

It has been proposed to change disease resistance specificity by reprogramming the expression of resistance genes or their corresponding avirulence genes. To reprogramme the resistance response of N towards bacterial pathogens, the helicase domain (p50) of the TMV replicase, the avirulence gene of N, was linked to synthetic promoters 4D and 2S2D harbouring elicitor-responsive cis-elements. These promoter::p50 constructs induce local necrotic lesions on NN tobacco plants in an Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration assay. A tobacco genotype void of N (nn) was transformed with the promoter::p50 constructs and subsequently crossed to NN plants. Nn F1 offspring selected for the T-DNA develop normally under sterile conditions. After transfer to soil, some of the F1 plants expressing the 2S2D::p50 constructs develop spontaneous necrosis. Transgenic Nn F1 plants with 4D::p50 and 2S2D::p50 expressing constructs upregulate p50 transcription and induce local necrotic lesions in an A. tumefaciens infiltration assay. When leaves and stems of Nn F1 offspring harbouring promoter::p50 constructs are infected with oncogenic A. tumefaciens C58, transgenic lines harbouring the 2S2D::p50 construct induce necrosis and completely lack tumor development. These results demonstrate a successful reprogramming of the viral N gene response against bacterial crown gall disease and highlight the importance of achieving tight regulation of avirulence gene expression and the control of necrosis in the presence of the corresponding resistance gene.",eng,2013,08,17,2013,8,21,ppublish,"Agrobacterium tumefaciens|Gene Expression Regulation, Viral|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D016960|D015967|D010935|D018515|D011401|D014026|D014027,

Viral vectors delivered by agrobacterial T-DNA transfer (magnifection) have also become important tools in research. In recent years, essential advances have been made both in the development of second-generation vectors designed using the 'deconstructed virus' approach, as well as in the development of upstream manufacturing processes that are robust and fully scalable. The strategy relies on Agrobacterium as a vector to deliver DNA copies of one or more viral RNA/DNA replicons; the bacteria are delivered into leaves by vacuum infiltration, and the viral machinery takes over from the point of T-DNA transfer to the plant cell nucleus, driving massive RNA and protein production and, if required, cell-to-cell spread of the replicons. Among the most often used viral backbones are those of the RNA viruses Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Potato virus X (PVX) and Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), and the DNA geminivirus Bean yellow dwarf virus. Prototypes of industrial processes that provide for high yield, rapid scale up and fast manufacturing cycles have been designed, and several GMP-compliant and GMP-certified manufacturing facilities are in place.

Theory suggests that the number of genome segments predicts the shape of the dose-response curve, but a rigorous test of this hypothesis has not been reported. Here, Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), a tripartite Alfamovirus, and transgenic Nicotianatabacum plants expressing no (wild type), one (P2), or two (P12) viral genome segments were used to test whether the number of genome segments necessary for infection predicts the dose response. The dose-response curve of wild-type plants was steep and congruent with the predicted kinetics of a multipartite virus, confirming previous results. Moreover, for P12 plants, the data support the IAH model, showing that the expression of virus genome segments by the host plant can modulate the infection kinetics of a tripartite virus to those of a monopartite virus. However, the different types of virus particles occurred at different frequencies, with a ratio of 116:45:1 (RNA1 to RNA2 to RNA3), which will affect infection kinetics and required analysis with a more comprehensive infection model. This analysis showed that each type of virus particle has a different probability of invading the host plant, at both the primary- and systemic-infection levels. While the number of genome segments affects the dose response, taking into consideration differences in the infection kinetics of the three types of AMV particles results in a better understanding of the infection process.

Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV) (genus Tospovirus; family Bunyaviridae) has emerged and has possibly caused diseases in various crops and ornamentals in Mexico. INSV was treated as a quarantine virus in Mexico (2) but not anymore. During the growing seasons of 2009 to 2011, surveys were conducted in the counties of Guanajuato and QuerÃ©taro in the states of the same names. Sampling included tomatillo (Physalis ixocarpa) and pepper (Capsicum spp.) plantations where plants with possible viral symptoms were observed. The symptoms observed were dark necrotic spots on some leaves and on the stems. These were similar to those observed elsewhere (3). Leaf spots further developed into localized necrotic areas. Using ELISA (Agdia, Elkhart, IN) with polyclonal antibodies, all collected samples showing symptoms tested positive for INSV and negative for Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Potato X virus (PVX), Potato Y virus (PVY), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), and Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV). In order to identify the causal agent of these symptoms, INSV-specific sequences available for the S genomic fragments were obtained from NCBI GenBank. They were aligned and used to design primers to amplify a 250-bp fragment from total extracted RNA from healthy and symptomatic plants using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Primers used were INSVF (5'CCCAACTGCCTCTTTAGTGC3') and INSVR (5'GGACAATGGATCTGCTCTGA3'). Three extracted plasmids, each containing an amplified and cloned fragment for the pepper and tomatillo isolates, were sequenced (GenBank Accession Nos. KC503051 and KC503052, respectively). Both nucleotide sequences showed 95% identity with the Chinese, Italian, and Japanese INSV sequences (FN400773, DQ425096, and AB207803, respectively) and 94% identity to other INSV isolates (4). The putative Mexican INSV pepper isolate, derived from a necrotic spot, was mechanically inoculated to other experimental host plants after grinding 1 g of symptomatic leaf tissue in 3 ml of a buffer with quaternary ammonium salts at 0.5%, pH 7.8. Ten plants, at the second true-leaf stage, of each Capsicum annuum cv. cannon and Citrullus lanatus were inoculated after carborundum abrasion of the second true leaf. At 15 days post inoculation, systemic chlorotic necrotic spots, stunting, and apical malformation were observed in capsicum plants while wilting was shown in watermelon plants. RT-PCR analyses and nucleotide sequence of the amplified product confirmed the presence and identity of both virus isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of INSV in Mexico found naturally in tomatillo and pepper and experimentally in watermelon plants. Derived from this report, INSV distribution in Mexico should be studied due to its potential impact on these two economically important crops.

Although I have endeavored to cover all aspects of structural virology and to acknowledge relevant individuals, I know that I have favored taking examples from my own experience in telling this story. I am anxious to apologize to all those who I might have unintentionally offended by omitting their work. The first knowledge of virus structure was a result of Stanley's studies of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and the subsequent X-ray fiber diffraction analysis by Bernal and Fankuchen in the 1930s. At about the same time it became apparent that crystals of small RNA plant and animal viruses could diffract X-rays, demonstrating that viruses must have distinct and unique structures. More advances were made in the 1950s with the realization by Watson and Crick that viruses might have icosahedral symmetry. With the improvement of experimental and computational techniques in the 1970s, it became possible to determine the three-dimensional, near-atomic resolution structures of some small icosahedral plant and animal RNA viruses. It was a great surprise that the protecting capsids of the first virus structures to be determined had the same architecture. The capsid proteins of these viruses all had a 'jelly-roll' fold and, furthermore, the organization of the capsid protein in the virus were similar, suggesting a common ancestral virus from which many of today's viruses have evolved. By this time a more detailed structure of TMV had also been established, but both the architecture and capsid protein fold were quite different to that of the icosahedral viruses. The small icosahedral RNA virus structures were also informative of how and where cellular receptors, anti-viral compounds, and neutralizing antibodies bound to these viruses. However, larger lipid membrane enveloped viruses did not form sufficiently ordered crystals to obtain good X-ray diffraction. Starting in the 1990s, these enveloped viruses were studied by combining cryo-electron microscopy of the whole virus with X-ray crystallography of their protein components. These structures gave information on virus assembly, virus neutralization by antibodies, and virus fusion with and entry into the host cell. The same techniques were also employed in the study of complex bacteriophages that were too large to crystallize. Nevertheless, there still remained many pleomorphic, highly pathogenic viruses that lacked the icosahedral symmetry and homogeneity that had made the earlier structural investigations possible. Currently some of these viruses are starting to be studied by combining X-ray crystallography with cryo-electron tomography.

While the Av/A4 mutants were as competent as the wild-type Av/A4 in RNA replication in protoplasts, their encapsidation, long-distance movement and virus accumulation varied significantly in N. benthamiana. These data suggest that the 3' NTR of AlMV sgRNA4 contains potential elements necessary for virus encapsidation.

First, how does the capsid protein select the viral RNA for packaging, when there are so many other candidate RNA molecules available? Second, what is the mechanism of assembly? With regard to the first question, there are a number of cases where a particular RNA sequence or structure--often one or more stem-loops--either promotes assembly or is required for assembly, but there are others where specific packaging signals are apparently not required. With regard to the assembly pathway, in those cases where stem-loops are involved, the first step is generally believed to be binding of the capsid proteins to these ""fingers"" of the RNA secondary structure. In the mature virus, the core of the RNA would then occupy the center of the viral particle, and the stem-loops would reach outward, towards the capsid, like stalagmites reaching up from the floor of a grotto towards the ceiling. Those viruses whose assembly does not depend on protein binding to stem-loops could have a different structure, with the core of the RNA lying just under the capsid, and the fingers reaching down into the interior of the virus, like stalactites. We review the literature on these alternative structures, focusing on RNA selectivity and the assembly mechanism, and we propose experiments aimed at determining, in a given virus, which of the two structures actually occurs.",eng,2013,04,27,2013,7,19,ppublish,"Genome, Viral|Levivirus|Models, Molecular|RNA Viruses|Tobacco mosaic satellite virus",D016679|D017909|D008958|D012328|D019400,

Previously, we reported induction of RNA interference effects in B. cockerelli via in vitro-prepared dsRNA/siRNAs after intrathoracic injection, and after feeding of artificial diets containing these effector RNAs. In order to deliver RNAi effectors via plant hosts and to rapidly identify effective target sequences in plant-feeding B. cockerelli, here we developed a plant virus vector-based in planta system for evaluating candidate sequences. We show that recombinant Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) containing B. cockerelli sequences can efficiently infect and generate small interfering RNAs in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), tomatillo (Physalis philadelphica) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants, and more importantly delivery of interfering sequences via TMV induces RNAi effects, as measured by actin and V-ATPase mRNA reductions, in B. cockerelli feeding on these plants. RNAi effects were primarily detected in the B. cockerelli guts. In contrast to our results with TMV, recombinant Potato virus X (PVX) and Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) did not give robust infections in all plants and did not induce detectable RNAi effects in B. cockerelli. The greatest RNA interference effects were observed when B. cockerelli nymphs were allowed to feed on leaf discs collected from inoculated or lower expanded leaves from corresponding TMV-infected plants. Tomatillo plants infected with recombinant TMV containing B. cockerelli actin or V-ATPase sequences also showed phenotypic effects resulting in decreased B. cockerelli progeny production as compared to plants infected by recombinant TMV containing GFP. These results showed that RNAi effects can be achieved in plants against the phloem feeder, B. cockerelli, and the TMV-plant system will provide a faster and more convenient method for screening of suitable RNAi target sequences in planta.",eng,2013,06,18,2013,7,5,epublish,"Adenosine Triphosphatases|Animals|Disease Vectors|Hemiptera|Lycopersicon esculentum|Plant Diseases|RNA Interference|Recombination, Genetic|Solanum tuberosum|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D000251|D000818|D004199|D006430|D018551|D010935|D034622|D011995|D011198|D014026|D014027,

In May of 2012, virus-like symptoms including bright yellow calico mosaic, leaf distortion, and growth reduction were observed on 15% of lavandin plants in a commercial nursery in Banovo Brdo locality, Baranja County, Republic of Croatia. Leaves from 15 symptomatic lavandin plants were collected and examined by double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA using commercial antisera (Bioreba AG, Reinach, Switzerland) against two viruses known to infect Lavandula spp.: Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) (2,3). Commercial positive and negative controls and extracts from healthy lavandin leaves were included in each ELISA. Only AMV was detected serologically in all 15 tested samples. Five plants each of Chenopodium quinoa, C. amaranticolor, and Nicotiana benthamiana were mechanically inoculated with sap from an ELISA-positive sample (70-12) using 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7). Local chlorotic spots accompanied by systemic mosaic on both Chenopodium species and bright yellow mosaic on N. benthamiana were observed 6 and 12 days post-inoculation, respectively. Test plants were assayed by DAS-ELISA and all inoculated plants of each species tested positive for AMV. The presence of AMV in all symptomatic lavandin plants was further confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay. Total nucleic acid was extracted using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RT-PCR was performed with the One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) using AMV specific primer pair CP AMV1 (5'-TCCATCATGAGTTCTTCAC-3') and CP AMV2 (5'-AGGACTTCATACCTTGACC-3') (1). Total RNAs obtained from the Serbian AMV isolate from alfalfa (GenBank Accession No. FJ527748) and healthy L. Ã intermedia plant served as the positive and negative control, respectively. The 751-bp amplicons, covering the partial coat protein (CP) gene and 3'-UTR, were obtained from all 15 samples that were serologically positive to AMV as well as from positive control. No amplification product was observed when extract from healthy L. Ã intermedia plant was used as template in the RT-PCR assay. The RT-PCR product derived from isolate 70-12 was directly sequenced in both directions using the same primer pair as in RT-PCR and deposited in GenBank (JX996119). Multiple sequence alignment of the CP open reading frame was performed by MEGA5 software (4) and revealed that the isolate 70-12 showed the highest nucleotide identity of 99.4% (99.5% amino acid identity) with Serbian AMV isolate from tobacco (FJ527749). To our knowledge, this is the first report of AMV on L. Ã intermedia in Croatia. Because lavandin is an aromatic plant traditionally and widely grown in Croatia, the presence of AMV could be a limiting factor for its successful production. References: (1) M. M.

Five plant viral suppressors of RNA silencing were evaluated for their ability to counteract gene silencing and enhance the expression of the Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP) or the Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in sugarcane, a major sugar and biomass producing polyploid. Functionality of these suppressors was first verified in Nicotiana benthamiana and onion epidermal cells, and later tested by transient expression in sugarcane young leaf segments and protoplasts. In young leaf segments co-expressing a suppressor, EYFP reached its maximum expression at 48-96 h post-DNA introduction and maintained its peak expression for a longer time compared with that in the absence of a suppressor. Among the five suppressors, Tomato bushy stunt virus-encoded P19 and Barley stripe mosaic virus-encoded Î³b were the most efficient. Co-expression with P19 and Î³b enhanced EYFP expression 4.6-fold and 3.6-fold in young leaf segments, and GUS activity 2.3-fold and 2.4-fold in protoplasts compared with those in the absence of a suppressor, respectively. In transgenic sugarcane, co-expression of GUS and P19 suppressor showed the highest accumulation of GUS levels with an average of 2.7-fold more than when GUS was expressed alone, with no detrimental phenotypic effects. The two established transient expression assays, based on young leaf segments and protoplasts, and confirmed by stable transgene expression, offer a rapid versatile system to verify the efficiency of RNA silencing suppressors that proved to be valuable in enhancing and stabilizing transgene expression in sugarcane.

Previous work has shown that a hybrid virus, FRad35(2b) -CMV (renamed here as CMV-FRad2b-Pro), generated by replacement of the 2b gene of strain Fny-CMV with that from Rad35-CMV, displays markedly lower pathogenicity than Fny-CMV on Nicotiana species. However, the replacement of proline with leucine at position 55 of the 2b protein of CMV-FRad2b-Pro (protein Rad2b-Pro) created a virus (CMV-FRad2b-Leu) that induced severe symptoms. Infection of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants defective in the expression of DICER-like (DCL) endoribonucleases 2 and 4, which mediate antiviral RNA silencing, as well as of dcl3 and dcl2/3/4 triple-mutant plants, indicated that Rad2b-Pro was a weaker RNA silencing suppressor than the protein Rad2b-Leu. This was confirmed in Nicotiana benthamiana using agroinfiltration assays, showing that, compared with either Rad2b-Leu or the Fny2b protein, Rad2b-Pro was ineffective at inhibiting local or systemic silencing of expression of a green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Transgenic expression of Rad2b-Leu, but not of Rad2b-Pro, in Arabidopsis induced symptom-like phenotypes and rescued the accumulation of the 2b-deletion mutant Fny-CMVÎ2b. Bimolecular fluorescent complementation indicated that, inâplanta, Rad2b-Leu, but not Rad2b-Pro, self-interacts.

Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV, genus Furovirus) was able to infect wheat and Nicotiana benthamiana plants at 16 but not at 24Â°C. When CWMV-infected plants were transferred to 24Â°C for 2 weeks, the newly emerged leaves and roots became virus free. Co-infection with Potato virus Y rescued CWMV accumulation in N. benthamiana plants after a temperature shift to 24Â°C. In transgenic N. benthamiana plants silenced for the N. benthamiana RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (NbRDR6), CWMV was able to accumulate in roots but not in leaves after a temperature shift to 24Â°C. Deep sequencing of small RNAs showed that, at 16Â°C, abundant CWMV small interfering (si)RNAs accumulated in infected N. benthamiana plants. Silencing of NbRDR6 increased the abundance of CWMV siRNAs and the generation of siRNAs from hotspots in the CWMV genome. In contrast, when shifted to 24Â°C for 1 week, CWMV siRNAs were markedly fewer in roots of NbRDR6-silenced than in roots of wild-type plants but were similar in the leaves of those plants.

To characterize polyadenylation activity in the BaMV replicase complex, we performed the in vitro polyadenylation with various BaMV templates. We conducted a polyadenylation activity assay for BaMV RNA by using a partially purified BaMV replicase complex. The results showed that approximately 200 adenylates at the 3' end of the RNA were generated on the endogenous RNA templates. Specific fractions derived from uninfected Nicotiana benthamiana plants enhanced the polyadenylation activity, implying that host factors are involved in polyadenylation. Furthermore, polyadenylation can be detected in newly synthesized plus-strand RNA in vitro when using the exogenous BaMV minus-strand minigenome. For polyadenylation on the exogenous plus-strand minigenome, the 3' end requires at least 4A to reach 22% polyadenylation activity. The results indicate that the BaMV replicase complex recognizes the 3' end of BaMV for polyadenylation.

Despite being an ideal source, the Escherichia coli -derived TMV nanorod is suffering from tenuous assembly capability and stability. Inspired by the disulfide bond widely employed in biosystems, here we rationally introduce a cysteine into TMV coat protein (TMV-CP) to enable disulfide bond formation between adjacent subunits, thereby radically altering the behaviors of original noncovalent assembling system of wild type TMV-CP. The dramatically enhanced self-assembly capability and stability of the engineered TMV nanorods are observed and the essential roles of disulfide bonds are verified, illustrating a promising strategy to obtain desired genetic-modified nanorods that are inaccessible in plants.

However, the virus entity that is delivered to plasmodesmata (PD) and its association with TGBp3-based complexes are not known. Results from chemical extraction and partial proteolysis of TGBp3 in membrane vesicles revealed that TGBp3 has a right-side-out membrane topology; i.e., TGBp3 has its C-terminal tail exposed to the outer surface of ER. Analyses of the TGBp3-specific immunoprecipitate of Sarkosyl-extracted TGBp3-based complex revealed that TGBp1, TGBp2, TGBp3, capsid protein (CP), replicase and viral RNA are potential constituents of virus movement complex. Substantial co-fractionation of TGBp2, TGBp3 and CP, but not TGBp1, in the early eluted gel filtration fractions in which virions were detected after TGBp3-specific immunoprecipitation suggested that the TGBp2- and TGBp3-based complex is able to stably associate with the virion. This notion was confirmed by immunogold-labeling transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of the purified virions. In addition, mutational and confocal microscopy analyses revealed that TGBp3 plays a key role in virus cell-to-cell movement by enhancing the TGBp2- and TGBp3-dependent PD localization of TGBp1.

Our previous transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis showed that ectopic expression of wild-type (wt) capsid protein (CP) of Brome mosaic virus (BMV) has an intrinsic property of modifying the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to induce vesicles similar to those present in wt BMV infection. In this study, we evaluated the functional significance of CP-mediated vesicle induction to the BMV infection cycle in planta. Consequently, the cytopathologic changes induced by wt CP or its mutants defective in virion assembly due to mutations engineered in either N- or C-proximal domains were comparatively analyzed by TEM in two susceptible (Nicotiana benthamiana and Chenopodium quinoa) and one nonhost (N. clevelandii) plant species. The results showed that in susceptible hosts, CP-mediated ER-derived vesicle induction is contingent on the expression of encapsidation-competent CP. In contrast, unlike in N. benthamiana and C. quinoa, transient expression of wt CP in nonhost N. clevelandii plants eliminated vesicle induction. Additionally, comparative source-to-sink analysis of virus spread in leaves of N. benthamiana and N. clevelandii coexpressing wt BMV and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) showed that despite trans-encapsidation, CMV failed to complement the defective cell-to-cell movement of BMV.

SGT1 is an integral component of a multi-protein network that includes RACK1, Rac1, RAR1, Rboh, HSP90 and HSP70, and in rice the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK), OsMAPK6. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) N protein, which belongs to the Toll-Interleukin Receptor (TIR)-NB-LRR class of R proteins, confers resistance to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). Following transient expression in planta, we analyzed the functional relationship between SGT1, SIPK - a tobacco MAPK6 ortholog - and N, using mass spectrometry, confocal microscopy and pathogen assays. Here, we show that tobacco SGT1 undergoes specific phosphorylation in a canonical MAPK target-motif by SIPK. Mutation of this motif to mimic SIPK phosphorylation leads to an increased proportion of cells displaying SGT1 nuclear accumulation and impairs N-mediated resistance to TMV, as does phospho-null substitution at the same residue. Forced nuclear localization of SGT1 causes N to be confined to nuclei. Our data suggest that one mode of regulating nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of R proteins is by maintaining appropriate levels of SGT1 phosphorylation catalyzed by plant MAPK.

Two recent studies have reported in vivo MOI estimates for Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), using sophisticated approaches to measure the distribution of two virus variants over host cells. Although the experimental approaches were similar, the studies employed different definitions of MOI and estimation methods. Here, new model-selection-based methods for calculating MOI were developed. Seven alternative models for predicting MOI were formulated that incorporate an increasing number of parameters. For both datasets the best-supported model included spatial segregation of virus variants over time, and to a lesser extent aggregation of virus-infected cells was also implicated. Three methods for MOI estimation were then compared: the two previously reported methods and the best-supported model. For CaMV data, all three methods gave comparable results. For TMV data, the previously reported methods both predicted low MOI values (range: 1.04-1.23) over time, whereas the best-supported model predicted a wider range of MOI values (range: 1.01-2.10) and an increase in MOI over time. Model selection can therefore identify suitable alternative MOI models and suggest key mechanisms affecting the frequency of coinfected cells.

The plants selected for analysis included those showing atypical growth including leaf deformation, yellowing, cupping or spotting, vein clearing, shortening of internodes, and reduced vigor. Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV; genus Nepovirus, family Secoviridae) was detected in leaf tissue and wood scrapings in two vines using the DAS-ELISA with antibodies from Bioreba (Reinach, Switzerland). The ArMV positive vines were from Vitis hybrid cultivars Noah and Geisenheim 26. ArMV was also detected in these two vines using the macroarray, with hybridization observed to 24 of 32 oligonucleotide probes specific to this virus. To confirm the identification of the virus, total RNAs were extracted from leaf tissues, hybridized with random hexamers, and reverse-transcribed using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Complementary DNAs were amplified by PCR using an IQ supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA), and two sets of generic primers for nepoviruses (1,4). Thermocycler conditions were 94Â°C 5 min (1Ã); 94Â°C 30 s, 50Â°C 30 s, and 69Â°C 2 min (35Ã), and 72Â°C for 5 min. The PCR products were sequenced directly. Sequences from the 340-bp products obtained from cultivars Geisenheim 26 (GenBank Accession No. HE984333) and Noah (HE984334) using the Wei et al. primers (4) had 76 to 84% sequence identity to ArMV RNA1 GenBank accessions GQ369528 and AY303786. Sequences from the 301-bp products obtained from cultivars Geisenheim 26 (HE984335) and Noah (HE984336) using the Digiaro et al. primers (1) had 87 to 91% sequence identity to ArMV RNA2 GenBank accessions AY017339 and X81814. ArMV was mechanically transmitted from Geisenheim 26 to Nicotiana tabacum cultivar Xanthi NN. Inoculation gave rise to necrotic local lesions on the inoculated leaves of five plants in each of two experiments (10 of 10 plants total). The presence of ArMV in tobacco was confirmed by DAS-ELISA. Thus, the presence of ArMV in New York grapevines has been confirmed by the detection of the coat protein antigen, virus specific oligonucleotide probes, and the sequencing of portions of both genomic RNAs. There are limited reports of ArMV in North America and in grapevine in particular (2), but with a wide host range and seed and nematode transmissibility, ArMV has the ability to become more widespread among grapevine and other crops.

In April 2012, virus-like symptoms including chlorotic leaf patterns and curling followed by necrosis and distortion of leaves were observed on five outdoor-grown brugmansia plants in a private garden in Mackovac, Rasina District, Serbia. Symptomatic leaves were tested for the presence of several common ornamental viruses including Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) by commercial double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA diagnostic kits (Bioreba AG, Reinach, Switzerland). Commercial positive and negative controls and extract from healthy brugmansia leaves were included in each ELISA. TSWV was detected serologically in all five brugmansia samples and all tested samples were negative for INSV, CMV, and TMV. The virus was mechanically transmitted from an ELISA-positive sample (41-12) to five plants of each Petuina Ã hybrida and Nicotiana glutinosa. Inoculated P. Ã hybrida plants showed local necrotic lesions and N. glutinosa showed mosaic and systemic necrosis 4 and 12 days post-inoculation, respectively, which were consistent with symptoms caused by TSWV (1). For further confirmation of TSWV infection, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was performed with the OneStep RT-PCR (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using a set of TSWV-specific primers, TSWV CP-f and TSWV CP-r (4), designed to amplify a 738-bp fragment of the nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. Total RNAs from naturally infected brugmansia and symptomatic N. glutinosa plants were extracted using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNAs obtained from the Serbian tobacco isolate of TSWV (GenBank Accession No. GQ373173) and healthy brugmansia plants were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The expected size of the RT-PCR product was amplified from symptomatic brugmansia and N. glutinosa but not from healthy tissues. The amplified product derived from the isolate 41-12 was sequenced directly after purification with the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), deposited in GenBank (JX468080), and subjected to sequence analysis by MEGA5 software (3). Sequence comparisons revealed that the Serbian isolate 41-12 shared the highest nucleotide identity of 99.9% (99.5% amino acid identity) with an Italian TSWV isolate P105/2006RB (DQ915946) originating from pepper. To our knowledge, this is the first report of TSWV on brugmansia in Serbia. Due to the increasing popularity and economic importance of brugmansia as an ornamental crop, thorough inspections and subsequent testing for TSWV and other viruses are needed. This high-value ornamental plant may act also as reservoir for the virus that can infect other ornamentals and cultivated crops, considering that TSWV has a very broad host range (2).

Here, we investigated the role of QS in the ISR elicited by the rhizobacterium, Serratia marcescens strain 90-166, in tobacco. Since S. marcescens 90-166 produces at least three QS signals, QS-mediated ISR in strain 90-166 has been difficult to understand. Therefore, we investigated the ISR capacity of two transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants that contained either bacterial acylhomoserine lactone-producing (AHL) or -degrading (AiiA) genes in conjunction with S. marcescens 90-166 to induce resistance against bacterial and viral pathogens. Root application of S. marcescens 90-166 increased ISR to the bacterial pathogens, Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci, in AHL plants and decreased ISR in AiiA plants. In contrast, ISR to Cucumber mosaic virus was reduced in AHL plants treated with S. marcescens 90-166 but enhanced in AiiA plants. Taken together, these data indicate that QS-dependent ISR is elicited by S. marcescens 90-166 in a pathogen-dependent manner. This study provides insight into QS-dependent ISR in tobacco elicited by S. marcescens 90-166.

The results show a significant decrease in BaMV RNA accumulation when the expression level of NbGSTU4 is reduced; whereas the viral RNA accumulation increases when NbGSTU4 is transiently expressed. Furthermore, this study identified that the involvement of NbGSTU4 in viral RNA accumulation occurs by its participation in the viral early replication step. The findings show that the NbGSTU4 protein expressed from Escherichia coli can interact with the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the BaMV RNA in vitro in the presence of glutathione (GSH). The addition of GSH in the in vitro replication assay shows an enhancement of minus-strand but not plus-strand RNA synthesis.

We have previously demonstrated that upon plant potyvirus infection, the potyviral 6K2 integral membrane protein induces the formation of ER-derived replication vesicles that subsequently target chloroplasts for robust genome replication. Here, we report that following the trafficking of the Turnip mosaic potyvirus (TuMV) 6K2 vesicles to chloroplasts, 6K2 vesicles accumulate at the chloroplasts to form chloroplast-bound elongated tubular structures followed by chloroplast aggregation. A functional actomyosin motility system is required for this process. As vesicle trafficking and fusion in planta are facilitated by a superfamily of proteins known as SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive-factor attachment protein receptors), we screened ER-localized SNARES or SNARE-like proteins for their possible involvement in TuMV infection. We identified Syp71 and Vap27-1 that colocalize with the chloroplast-bound 6K2 complex. Knockdown of their expression using a Tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-based virus-induced gene silencing vector showed that Syp71 but not Vap27-1 is essential for TuMV infection. In Syp71-downregulated plant cells, the formation of 6K2-induced chloroplast-bound elongated tubular structures and chloroplast aggregates is inhibited and virus accumulation is significantly reduced, but the trafficking of the 6K2 vesicles from the ER to chloroplast is not affected.

In the present study, we report the in vitro antiviral activities of 29 essential oils, extracted from Chinese indigenous aromatic plants, against the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Of these essential oils, those oils from ginger, lemon, tea tree, tangerine peel, artemisia, and lemongrass effected a more than 50% inhibition of TMV at 100 Î¼g/ml. In addition, the mode of antiviral action of the active essential oils was also determined. Essential oils isolated from artemisia and lemongrass possessed potent inactivation and curative effects in vivo and had a directly passivating effect on TMV infection in a dose-dependent manner. However, all other active essential oils exhibited a moderate protective effect in vivo. The chemical constitutions of the essential oils from ginger, lemon, tea tree, tangerine peel, artemisia, and lemongrass were identified by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The major components of these essential oils were Î±-zingiberene (35.21%), limonene (76.25%), terpinen-4-ol (41.20%), limonene (80.95%), 1,8-cineole (27.45%), and terpinolene (10.67%). The curative effects of 10 individual compounds from the active essential oils on TMV infection were also examined in vivo. The compounds from citronellal, limonene, 1,8-cineole, and Î±-zingiberene effected a more than 40% inhibition rate for TMV infection, and the other compounds demonstrated moderate activities at 320 Î¼g/ml in vivo. There results indicate that the essential oils isolated from artemisia and lemongrass, and the individual compound citronellal, have the potential to be used as an effective alternative for the treatment of tobacco plants infected with TMV under greenhouse conditions.",eng,,,,2013,5,17,ppublish,"Antiviral Agents|China|Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry|Inhibitory Concentration 50|Oils, Volatile|Plant Diseases|Plants|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D000998|D002681|D008401|D020128|D009822|D010935|D010944|D014027,

Previously, we have shown that interfering satellite RNA (satRNA) of Bamboo mosaic virus (satBaMV) greatly reduces Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) accumulation and BaMV-induced symptoms in co-inoculated plants. Here, we generated a nonviral source of virus-resistant transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana by introducing interfering satBaMV. Asymptomatic transgenic N.âbenthamiana lines were highly resistant to BaMV virion and viral RNA infection, and the expression of the transgene BSL6 was higher in asymptomatic than mildly symptomatic lines. In addition, BaMV- and satBaMV-specific small RNAs were detectable only after BaMV challenge, and their levels were associated with genomic viral RNA or satRNA levels. By transcriptomic analysis, the salicylic acid (SA) signalling pathway was not induced in satBaMV transgenic A.âthaliana in mock conditions, suggesting that two major antiviral mechanisms, RNA silencing and SA-mediated resistance, are not involved directly in transgenic satBaMV-mediated BaMV interference. In contrast, resistance is associated with the level of the interfering satBaMV transgene. We propose satBaMV-mediated BaMV interference in transgenic plants by competition for replicase with BaMV.

Tm-1 encodes a protein that binds ToMV replication proteins and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA replication of ToMV. The replication proteins of resistance-breaking mutants of ToMV do not bind Tm-1, indicating that the binding is important for inhibition. In this study, we analyzed how Tm-1 inhibits ToMV RNA replication in a cell-free system using evacuolated tobacco protoplast extracts. In this system, ToMV RNA replication is catalyzed by replication proteins bound to membranes, and the RNA polymerase activity is unaffected by treatment with 0.5 M NaCl-containing buffer and remains associated with membranes. We show that in the presence of Tm-1, negative-strand RNA synthesis is inhibited; the replication proteins associate with membranes with binding that is sensitive to 0.5 M NaCl; the viral genomic RNA used as a translation template is not protected from nuclease digestion; and host membrane proteins TOM1, TOM2A, and ARL8 are not copurified with the membrane-bound 130K replication protein. Deletion of the polymerase read-through domain or of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the genome did not prevent the formation of complexes between the 130K protein and the host membrane proteins, the 0.5 M NaCl-resistant binding of the replication proteins to membranes, and the protection of the genomic RNA from nucleases.

In this study, the N gene promoter was cloned and fused with two different reporter genes, one encoding Î²-glucuronidase (N::GUS) and another, luciferase (N::LUC). Tobacco plants transformed with the N::GUS or N::LUC reporter constructs were screened for homozygosity and stable expression. Histochemical analysis of N::GUS tobacco plants revealed that the expression is organ specific and developmentally regulated. Whereas two week old plants expressed GUS in midveins only, 6-wk-old plants also expressed GUS in leaf lamella. Roots did not show GUS expression at any time during development. Experiments to address effects of external stress were performed using N::LUC tobacco plants.

Here, we investigate the role of Arabidopsis BG in tobamovirus spread. During Turnip vein clearing virus infection, the transcription of two pathogenesis-related (PR)-BG AtBG2 and AtBG3 increased but that of Pd-associated BG AtBG_pap did not change. In transgenic plants, AtBG2 was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network and was not secreted. As a stress response mediated by salicylic acid, AtBG2 was secreted and appeared as a free extracellular protein localized in the entire apoplast but did not accumulate at Pd sites. At the leading edge of Tobacco mosaic virus spread, AtBG2 co-localized with the viral movement protein in the ER-derived bodies, similarly to other ER proteins, but was not secreted to the cell wall. In atbg2 mutants, callose levels at Pd and virus spread were unaffected. Likewise, AtBG2 overexpression had no effect on virus spread. However, in atbg_pap mutants, callose at Pd was increased and virus spread was reduced. Our results demonstrate that the constitutive Pd-associated BG but not the stress-regulated extracellular PR-BG are directly involved in regulation of callose at Pd and cell-to-cell transport in Arabidopsis, including the spread of viruses.

Here, we report that Arabidopsis thaliana WRKY DNA-binding protein 8 (WRKY8) has a role in mediating the long-distance movement of crucifer-infecting tobacco mosaic virus (TMV-cg). The expression of WRKY8 was inhibited by TMV-cg infection, and mutation of WRKY8 accelerated the accumulation of TMV-cg in systemically infected leaves. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of ABA insensitive 4 (ABI4) was reduced and the expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase 6 (ACS6) and ethylene response factor 104 (ERF104) was enhanced in the systemically infected leaves of wrky8. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that WRKY8 could bind selectively to putative W-boxes of the ABI4, ACS6, and ERF104 promoters. Furthermore, TMV-cg infection enhanced WRKY8 binding to the ABI4 promoter but reduced the binding of WRKY8 to the ACS6 and ERF104 promoters, indicating that regulation of ABI4, ACS6, and ERF104 by WRKY8 is at least partially dependent on TMV-cg. Exogenous applications of abscisic acid (ABA) reduced the systemic accumulation of TMV-cg. Mutations in ABA deficient 1, ABA deficient 2, ABA deficient 3, or abi4 accelerated systemic TMV-cg accumulation. In contrast, exogenous application of aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid enhanced the systemic accumulation of TMV-cg, but mutations in acs6, erf104, or an octuple acs mutant inhibited systemic TMV-cg accumulation. Our results demonstrate that WRKY8 is involved in the defense response against TMV-cg through the direct regulation of the expression of ABI4, ACS6, and ERF104 and may mediate the crosstalk between ABA and ethylene signaling during the TMV-cg-Arabidopsis interaction.",eng,2013,05,06,2013,5,8,ppublish,"Abscisic Acid|Arabidopsis|Arabidopsis Proteins|Ethylenes|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Lyases|Mutation|Plant Diseases|Plant Growth Regulators|Plant Immunity|Response Elements|Signal Transduction|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Transcription Factors",D000040|D017360|D029681|D005030|D018506|D008190|D009154|D010935|D010937|D057865|D020218|D015398|D014027|D014157,ABA signaling|ET signaling|WRKY8 regulation|virus movement

They therefore have great potential for the production of heteromultimeric protein complexes. This work describes the efficient plant-based production and assembly of Bluetongue virus-like particles (VLPs), requiring the simultaneous expression of four distinct proteins in varying amounts. Such particles have the potential to serve as a safe and effective vaccine against Bluetongue virus (BTV), which causes high mortality rates in ruminants and thus has a severe effect on the livestock trade. Here, VLPs produced and assembled in Nicotiana benthamiana using the cowpea mosaic virus-based HyperTrans (CPMV-HT) and associated pEAQ plant transient expression vector system were shown to elicit a strong antibody response in sheep. Furthermore, they provided protective immunity against a challenge with a South African BTV-8 field isolate. The results show that transient expression can be used to produce immunologically relevant complex heteromultimeric structures in plants in a matter of days. The results have implications beyond the realm of veterinary vaccines and could be applied to the production of VLPs for human use or the coexpression of multiple enzymes for the manipulation of metabolic pathways.

A serine/threonine kinase-like (NbSTKL) gene of Nicotiana benthamiana is upregulated after BaMV infection. NbSTKL contains the homologous domain of Ser/Thr kinase. Knocking down the expression of NbSTKL by virus-induced gene silencing reduced the accumulation of BaMV in the inoculated leaves but not in the protoplasts. The spread of GFP-expressing BaMV in the inoculated leaves is also impeded by a reduced expression of NbSTKL. These data imply that NbSTKL facilitates the cell-to-cell movement of BaMV. The subcellular localization of NbSTKL is mainly on the cell membrane, which has been confirmed by mutagenesis and fractionation experiments. Combined with the results showing that active site mutation of NbSTKL does not change its subcellular localization but significantly affects BaMV accumulation, we conclude that NbSTKL may regulate BaMV movement on the cell membrane by its kinase-like activity. Moreover, the transient expression of NbSTKL does not significantly affect the accumulation of Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Potato virus X (PVX); thus, NbSTKL might be a specific protein facilitating BaMV movement.",eng,2013,04,30,2013,5,7,epublish,"Catalytic Domain|DNA, Complementary|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Gene Knockdown Techniques|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Membrane Proteins|Mutation|Phosphorylation|Plant Leaves|Plant Proteins|Potexvirus|Protein Kinases|Protein Transport|Protoplasts|Tobacco|Virus Replication",D020134|D018076|D018506|D055785|D054884|D008565|D009154|D010766|D018515|D010940|D017863|D011494|D021381|D011523|D014026|D014779,

Here we describe its occurrence in six different soybean leaf samples collected from five Ohio counties: Champaign, Hardin, Sandusky, Seneca, and Wyandot. Specifically, SVNaV was initially identified through a comprehensive survey during the summer of 2011 that used high throughput sequencing to detect genome sequences of viruses present in a pool of 110 field samples collected from 24 Ohio counties. Three assembled contigs, with sizes of 7,551, 4,937, and 1,554 nucleotides (nt) respectively, share 99% nt identity with the three SVNaV genomic RNAs (L, M, and S), and thus constitute partial sequences of the SVNaV Ohio (OH) isolate. The distribution of this virus was further delineated using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with primers SVNaV-1734F (5' CCATCTTTCTTTCCAGGCATTTCA 3') and SVNaV-S-2421R (5' GATTCAAGTTCAGCGAGTTCTACAA 3'). All plants from which the SVNaV-positive samples were collected showed typical virus symptoms, including systemic mosaic accompanied by leaf deformation, chlorosis, vein necrosis, and rusty spots on mature leaves. These symptoms are largely consistent with the previous report by Zhou and colleagues (1). Intriguingly, further analysis with RT-PCR revealed that five out of the six SVNaV-positive samples also contained a second virus, with Bean pod mottle virus found in four of the samples, and Tobacco ringspot virus in the fifth. Since it is not yet possible to initiate SVNaV infection mechanically, it is difficult to determine whether the co-infecting viruses contribute to the disease symptoms and yield losses. It should be noted that SVNaV may have been in Ohio for some time since symptoms similar to those reported by Zhou and colleagues (1) have been observed in soybean fields of this state since at least 2009. Furthermore, while in 2011 these symptoms were observed in only a few fields, as reflected by the detection of SVNaV in six of the 110 samples, the 2012 growing season has seen a big jump of symptomatic plants and fields. The current report confirms its presence with molecular evidence and lays the groundwork for further assessment of its impact on soybean production. Reference: (1) J. Zhou et al.

The incidence of these symptoms was low (~1 to 5%), but they were distinct from those associated with known diseases in the region. A representative leaf sample with these symptoms was applied to filter paper (FTA cards, Whatman), and DNA and RNA extracts were prepared according to manufacturer instructions. RT-PCR tests for Tomato spotted wilt virus, Tobacco streak virus, Tomato necrotic spot virus, Tobacco/tomato mosaic viruses, Cucumber mosaic virus, Alfalfa mosaic virus, torradoviruses, and potyviruses, and PCR tests for begomoviruses, phytoplasmas, and 'Candidatus Liberibacter' infection were also negative. However, virus-like symptoms developed in all 16 tomato seedlings (cv. Early Pak 7) 7 to 10 days after mechanical (sap) inoculation with inoculum prepared from the FTA sample. No symptoms developed in mock-inoculated control plants (n = 3). Symptoms induced included stunted growth and severe epinasty of leaves, followed by necrosis of leaf veins, petioles, and stems. These symptoms were similar to those observed in plants in Mali. When RNA extracts prepared from leaves of these symptomatic plants were mechanically inoculated onto 24 tomato seedlings, similar symptoms developed in all plants, suggesting the causal agent might be a viroid. RT-PCR tests with RNA from symptomatic tomato leaves and universal (3) and various specific Pospiviroid primer pairs were negative. However, equivalent RT-PCR tests conducted with the pCLV4/pCLVR4 primer pair specific for Columnea latent viroid (CLVd) (2) generated a DNA fragment of the expected size (~370 bp). The sequence of this DNA fragment (GenBank Accession No. JQ362419) was 99% identical with those of CLVd isolates from the Netherlands (AY373446 and AY372396). In host range studies, the CLVd isolate from Mali induced symptoms in all 48 mechanically-inoculated tomato plants, whereas no symptoms developed (up to 90 days after inoculation) in inoculated Chenopodium quinoa, C. amaranticolor, Nicotiana benthamiana, N. tabacum (cvs. Havana, Glurk and Turkish), N. glutinosa, Datura stramonium, common bean (cvs. Topcrop and Pinto bean), pumpkin (cv. Small Sugar), pepper (Capsicum annuum, cv. Yolo Wonder) and cucumber (cvs. Emparator and Poinsett 76) plants (results of three independent experiments with six plants per experiment). Symptomless infections were detected in pepper (24 of 30), N. benthamiana (25 of 25), and N. tabacum cv. Turkish (11 of 24) plants by RT-PCR with the pCLV4/pCLVR4 primer pair. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CLVd infecting tomato in Mali. RT-PCR tests of seeds collected from CLVd-infected tomato, pepper, and N. benthamiana plants also detected CLVd (1). Thus, it is possible that CLVd was introduced into Mali in association with seed. References: (1) O. Batuman and R. L. Gilbertson. Phytopathology 102:S4.9, 2012. (2) R. L. Spieker. Arch.

1462,23623981,Virus research,Agroinoculation of a full-length cDNA clone of cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV) results in systemic infection in cotton and the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana.,10.1016/j.virusres.2013.04.007,"Cotton blue disease is the most important viral disease of cotton in the southern part of South America. Its etiological agent, cotton leafroll dwarf virus (CLRDV), is specifically transmitted to host plants by the aphid vector (Aphis gossypii) and any attempt to perform mechanical inoculations of this virus into its host has failed. This limitation has held back the study of this virus and the disease it causes. In this study, a full-length cDNA of CLRDV was constructed and expressed in vivo under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. An agrobacterium-mediated inoculation system for the cloned cDNA construct of CLRDV was developed. Northern and immunoblot analyses showed that after several weeks the replicon of CLRDV delivered by Agrobacterium tumefaciens in Gossypium hirsutum plants gave rise to a systemic infection and typical blue disease symptoms correlated to the presence of viral RNA and P3 capsid protein. We also demonstrated that the virus that accumulated in the agroinfected plants was transmissible by the vector A. gossypii. This result confirms the production of biologically active transmissible virions. In addition, the clone was infectious in Nicotiana benthamiana plants which developed interveinal chlorosis three weeks postinoculation and CLRDV was detected both in the inoculated and systemic leaves. Attempts to agroinfect Arabidopsis thaliana plants were irregularly successful. Although no symptoms were observed, the P3 capsid protein as well as the genomic and subgenomic RNAs were irregularly detected in systemic leaves of some agroinfiltrated plants.

The first step in VLCFA biosynthesis is the condensation of two carbons to an acyl-coenzyme A, which is catalyzed by 3-ketoacyl-coenzyme A synthase (KCS). In this study, amino acid sequence homology and the messenger RNA expression patterns of 21 Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) KCSs were compared. The in planta role of the KCS9 gene, showing higher expression in stem epidermal peels than in stems, was further investigated. The KCS9 gene was ubiquitously expressed in various organs and tissues, including roots, leaves, and stems, including epidermis, silique walls, sepals, the upper portion of the styles, and seed coats, but not in developing embryos. The fluorescent signals of the KCS9::enhanced yellow fluorescent protein construct were merged with those of BrFAD2::monomeric red fluorescent protein, which is an endoplasmic reticulum marker in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) epidermal cells. The kcs9 knockout mutants exhibited a significant reduction in C24 VLCFAs but an accumulation of C20 and C22 VLCFAs in the analysis of membrane and surface lipids. The mutant phenotypes were rescued by the expression of KCS9 under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Taken together, these data demonstrate that KCS9 is involved in the elongation of C22 to C24 fatty acids, which are essential precursors for the biosynthesis of cuticular waxes, aliphatic suberins, and membrane lipids, including sphingolipids and phospholipids.

This process requires both virus- and host-encoded proteins; however, the host factors involved and their role in this process remain largely unknown. On infection with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), a positive-strand RNA virus, the filamentous and tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) converts to aggregations at the early stage and returns to filamentous at the late infectious stage, termed the ER transition. Also, membrane- or vesicle-packaged viral replication complexes (VRCs) are induced early during infection. We used microarray assays to screen the Arabidopsis thaliana gene(s) responding to infection with TMV in the initial infection stage and identified an Arabidopsis gene, PAP85 (annotated as a vicilin-like seed storage protein), with upregulated expression during 0.5 to 6 h of TMV infection. TMV accumulation was reduced in pap85-RNA interference (RNAi) Arabidopsis and restored to wild-type levels when PAP85 was overexpressed in pap85-RNAi Arabidopsis. We did not observe the ER transition in TMV-infected PAP85-knockdown Arabidopsis protoplasts. In addition, TMV accumulation was reduced in PAP85-knockdown protoplasts. VRC accumulation was reduced, but not significantly (P = 0.06), in PAP85-knockdown protoplasts.

Accumulation of SA is induced by wounding in tobacco plants in which the expression of WIPK and SIPK, two mitogen-activated protein kinases, is suppressed. Here, the mechanisms underlying the abnormal accumulation of SA in WIPK/SIPK-suppressed plants have been characterized. SA accumulation started around 12 h after wounding and was inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor. SA accumulation, however, was enhanced several fold when leaf discs were transferred onto CHX after floating on water for â¥6 h. Temporal and spatial analyses of wound-induced and CHX-enhanced SA accumulation suggested that wounding induces activators for SA accumulation followed by the generation of repressors, and late CHX treatment inhibits the production of repressors more efficiently than that of activators. Microarray analysis revealed that the expression of many disease resistance-related genes, including N, a Resistance (R) gene for Tobacco mosaic virus and R gene-like genes, was up-regulated in wounded WIPK/SIPK-suppressed plants. Expression of the N gene and R gene-like genes peaked earlier than that of most other genes as well as SA accumulation, and was mainly induced in those parts of leaf discs where SA was highly accumulated. Moreover, wound-induced SA accumulation was decreased by the treatments which compromise the function of R proteins. These results indicate that signaling leading to the expression of disease resistance-related genes is activated by wounding in WIPK/SIPK-suppressed plants, and induction of R gene and R gene-like genes might lead to the biosynthesis of SA.",eng,2013,04,09,2013,4,12,ppublish,"Benzoquinones|Cycloheximide|Disease Resistance|Gene Expression Profiling|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Genes, Plant|Hot Temperature|Lactams, Macrocyclic|Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases|Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Protein Biosynthesis|Salicylic Acid|Suppression, Genetic|Tobacco|Transcriptional Activation|Up-Regulation",D016227|D003513|D060467|D020869|D018506|D017343|D006358|D047029|D020928|D020411|D010935|D018515|D014176|D020156|D013489|D014026|D015533|D015854,MAPK|Nicotiana tabacum|R gene|Salicylate|Wound

To counteract RNA silencing, viruses have evolved suppressor proteins able to block the mechanism at different stages. Virus-infected plants generally develop viral symptoms characterized by morphological changes. Recent works have shown that viral symptoms have at least two different origins related to sRNAs: these can be either due to the targeting of host genes by siRNAs of viral origins (vsiRNAs) or to alteration of the normal functioning of certain host sRNAs (endogenous sRNAs) important for plant development. Although Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is one of the most studied plant virus worldwide, the origin of its viral symptoms as well as that of the increased accumulation of microRNAs and other sRNAs remain to be clarified.

This fast-growing vine was originally planted as an ornamental for forage and to prevent erosion (2), but is now considered an invasive species. During April 2011, a kudzu plant growing near a soybean field in Amite (Tangipahoa Parish, southeastern LA) was observed with foliar ringspot and mottle symptoms. Leaf samples were collected, and sap extracts (diluted 1:5 w/v in 0.02 M phosphate buffer pH 7.2) were mechanically inoculated onto carborundum-dusted leaves of at least five plants of the following species: kudzu, common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) cv. Black Turtle Soup, globe amaranth (Gomphrena globosa), Nicotiana benthamiana, and soybean (Glycine max) cv. Asgrow AG 4801. Two plants of each species were also mock-inoculated. Eight to fourteen days after inoculation, all virus-inoculated plants showed virus symptoms that included foliar ringspots, mosaic, and mottle. Common bean and soybean also displayed necroses and were stunted. ELISA using antisera for Bean pod mottle virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, Soybean mosaic virus, and Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) (Agdia Inc., Elkhart, IN) were performed on field-collected kudzu and all inoculated plants species. ELISA tests resulted positive for TRSV but were negative for the other three viruses. All virus-inoculated plant species tested positive by ELISA. To confirm that TRSV was present in the samples, total RNA was extracted from infected and healthy plants and used in RT-PCR tests. The set of primers TRS-F (5'TATCCCTATGTGCTTGAGAG3') and TRS-R (5'CATAGACCACCAGAGTCACA3'), which amplifies a 766-bp fragment of the RdRp of TRSV, were used (3). Expected amplicons were obtained with all of the TRSV-infected plants and were cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis confirmed that TRSV was present in kudzu. Nucleotide sequence comparisons using BLAST resulted in a 95% similarity with the bud blight strain of TRSV which infects soybeans (GenBank Accession No. U50869) (1). TRSV has been reported to infect many wild plants and crops, including soybean. In soybean, this virus can reduce yield and seed quality (4). During summer 2012, three additional kudzu plants located near soybean fields showing ringspot symptoms were also found in Morehouse, Saint Landry, and West Feliciana Parishes. These three parishes correspond to the north, central, and southeast regions, respectively. These plants also tested positive for TRSV by ELISA and RT-PCR. The results of this investigation documents that TRSV was found naturally infecting kudzu near soybean fields in different geographical locations within Louisiana. Furthermore, a TRSV strain closely related to the bud blight strain that infects soybean was identified in one location (Amite). This finding is significant because infected kudzu potentially could serve as the source of TRSV for soybean and other economically important crops. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of TRSV infecting kudzu. References: (1) G. L. Hartman et al. 1999. Compendium of Soybean Diseases.

The paradigm for how a single MP regulates and coordinates these activities is the Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) 30-kDa protein (MP(TMV)). Detailed studies demonstrate that TMV multiplies exclusively in the cytoplasm and have documented associations of MP(TMV) with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, microtubules, and plasmodesmata throughout the course of infection. As TMV poorly infects Arabidopsis thaliana, Turnip vein clearing virus (TVCV) is the tobamovirus of choice for studies in this model plant. A key problem, which has contributed to confusion in the field, is the unproven assumption that the TVCV and TMV life cycles are identical. We engineered an infectious TVCV replicon that expressed a functional fluorescence-tagged MP(TVCV) and report here the unexpected discovery that MP(TVCV), beyond localizing to ER membrane and plasmodesmata, targeted to the nucleus in a nuclear localization signal (NLS)-dependent manner, where it localized to novel F-actin-containing filaments that associated with chromatin. The MP(TVCV) NLS appeared to be conserved in the subgroup 3 tobamoviruses, and our mutational analyses showed that nuclear localization of MP(TVCV) was necessary for efficient TVCV cell-to-cell movement and systemic infection in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. Our studies identify a novel nuclear stage in TVCV infection and suggest that nuclear MP encoded by TVCV and other subgroup 3 tobamoviruses interacts with F-actin and chromatin to modulate host defenses or cellular physiology to favor virus movement and infection.",eng,2013,03,27,2013,3,29,ppublish,Actin Cytoskeleton|Actins|Arabidopsis|Cell Nucleus|Nuclear Localization Signals|Plant Diseases|Plant Viral Movement Proteins|Protein Transport|Tobacco|Tobamovirus,D008841|D000199|D017360|D002467|D019913|D010935|D053830|D021381|D014026|D017898,

The arrangement of the resulting domains and final carrier rod length both were governed by RNA-templated two-step in vitro assembly. Two selectively addressable TMV CP mutants carrying either thiol (TMVCys) or amino (TMVLys) groups on the exposed surface were engineered and shown to retain reactivity towards maleimides or NHS esters, respectively, after acetic acid-based purification and re-assembly to novel carrier rod types.

Here, we tested whether the time of removing the infected leaves as well as viral titer have any effect on the degree of changes in HRF in systemic tissues. An increase in HRF in systemic non-infected tissues was more pronounced when the infected leaves were detached from the infected plants at 60-96 h post-infection, rather than at earlier time. Next, we found that exposure to higher concentrations of inoculum was much more efficient in triggering an increase in HRF than exposure to lower concentrations. Finally, we showed that older plants exhibited a higher increase in HRF than younger plants.

We identify a novel and conserved role for the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN (SBP)-domain transcription factor SPL6 in enabling the activation of the defense transcriptome following its association with a nuclear-localized immune receptor. During an active immune response, the Nicotiana TIR-NB-LRR N immune receptor associates with NbSPL6 within distinct nuclear compartments. NbSPL6 is essential for the N-mediated resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus. Similarly, the presumed Arabidopsis ortholog AtSPL6 is required for the resistance mediated by the TIR-NB-LRR RPS4 against Pseudomonas syringae carrying the avrRps4 effector. Transcriptome analysis indicates that AtSPL6 positively regulates a subset of defense genes.

As with the ill-defined ""gene"" of genetics, viruses were microbes whose nature had not been revealed. Some clarity arrived in 1929 when Francis O. Holmes, a scientist at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research (Yonkers, NY) reported that Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) could produce local necrotic lesions on tobacco plants and that these lesions were in proportion to dilutions of the inoculum. Holmes' method, the local lesion assay, provided the first evidence that viruses were discrete infectious particles, thus setting the stage for physicochemical studies of plant viruses. In a field where there are few eponymous methods or diseases, Holmes' assay continues to be a useful tool for the study of plant viruses.

UPR-related gene expression occurred within 8 h of TMV-p3 inoculation and declined before the onset of PCD. TGBp3-mediated cell death was suppressed in plants that overexpressed BiP, indicating that UPR induction by TGBp3 is a pro-survival mechanism. Anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-xl, CED-9 and Op-IAP were expressed in transgenic plants and suppressed N gene-mediated resistance to TMV, but failed to alleviate TGBp3-induced PCD.

The sheer range and types of viruses coupled with their intriguing properties potentially give endless opportunities for applications in virus-based technologies. Viruses have the ability to self- assemble into particles with discrete shape and size, specificity of symmetry, polyvalence, and stable properties under a wide range of temperature and pH conditions. Not surprisingly, with such a remarkable range of properties, viruses are proposed for use in biomaterials, vaccines, electronic materials, chemical tools, and molecular electronic containers. In order to utilize viruses in nanotechnology, they must be modified from their natural forms to impart new functions. This challenging process can be performed through several mechanisms including genetic modification of the viral genome and chemically attaching foreign or desired molecules to the virus particle reactive groups. The ability to modify a virus primarily depends upon the physiochemical and physical properties of the virus. In addition, the genetic or physiochemical modifications need to be performed without adversely affecting the virus native structure and virus function. Maize rayado fino virus (MRFV) coat proteins self-assemble in Escherichia coli producing stable and empty VLPs that are stabilized by protein-protein interactions and that can be used in virus-based technologies applications. VLPs produced in tobacco plants were examined as a scaffold on which a variety of peptides can be covalently displayed. Here, we describe the steps to 1) determine which of the solvent-accessible cysteines in a virus capsid are available for modification, and 2) bioconjugate peptides to the modified capsids. By using native or mutationally-inserted amino acid residues and standard coupling technologies, a wide variety of materials have been displayed on the surface of plant viruses such as, Brome mosaic virus, Carnation mottle virus, Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, Tobacco mosaic virus, Turnip yellow mosaic virus, and MRFV.",eng,2013,02,14,2013,2,27,epublish,Cysteine|Tobacco|Tymoviridae|Viral Proteins|Virion,D003545|D014026|D046830|D014764|D014771,

The mechanisms that prevent the infection of a challenge virus into a previously infected cell, a phenomenon known as superinfection exclusion (SE) or Homologous Interference, are only partially understood. By taking advantage of a deconstructed tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) system, where the capsid protein (CP) gene is replaced by fluorescent proteins, an exclusion mechanism independent of CP was unveiled. Time-course superinfection experiments provided insights into SE dynamics. Initial infection levels affecting less than 10Â % of cells led to full immunization in only 48Â h, and measurable immunization levels were detected as early as 6Â h post-primary infection. Depletion of a functional movement protein (MP) was also seen to slow down, but not to prevent, the SE mechanism. These observations suggest a CP-independent mechanism based on competition for a host-limiting factor, which operates at very low virus concentration.

AC4/C4, which is nested completely within the Rep gene, is less conserved among geminiviruses. Much less is known about its role in viral pathogenesis other than its known role in the suppression of host-mediated gene silencing. Transient expression of MYMV AC4 by agroinfiltration suppressed post-transcriptional gene silencing in Nicotiana benthamiana 16c expressing green fluorescence protein, at a level comparable to MYMV TrAP expression. AC4 full-length gene and an inverted repeat of AC4 (comprising the full-length AC4 sequence in sense and antisense orientations with an intervening intron) which makes a hairpin RNA (hpRNA) upon transcription were introduced into tobacco by Agrobacterium-mediated leaf disc transformation. Leaf discs of the transgenic plants were agroinoculated with partial dimers of MYMV and used to study the effect of the AC4-sense and AC4 hpRNA genes on MYMV DNA accumulation. Leaf discs of two transgenic plants that express the AC4-sense gene displayed an increase in MYMV DNA accumulation. Leaf discs of six transgenic plants containing the AC4 hpRNA gene accumulated small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific to AC4, and upon agroinoculation with MYMV they exhibited a severe reduction in the accumulation of MYMV DNA.

1511,23394564,Current pharmaceutical design,Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of candidate universal influenza A nanovaccines produced in plants by Tobacco mosaic virus-based vectors.,,"A new approach for super-expression of the influenza virus epitope M2e in plants has been developed on the basis of a recombinant Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV, strain U1) genome designed for Agrobacterium-mediated delivery into the plant cell nucleus. The TMV coat protein (CP) served as a carrier and three versions of the M2e sequence were inserted into the surface loop between amino acid residues 155 and 156. Cysteine residues in the heterologous peptide were thought likely to impede efficient assembly of chimeric particles. Therefore, viral vectors TMV-M2e-ala and TMV-M2e-ser were constructed in which cysteine codons 17 and 19 of the M2e epitope were substituted by codons for serine or alanine. Agroinfiltration experiments proved that the chimeric viruses were capable of systemically infecting Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Antisera raised against TMV-M2e-ala virions appear to contain far more antibodies specific to influenza virus M2e than those specific to TMV carrier particle (ratio 5:1). Immunogold electron microscopy showed that the 2-epitopes were uniformly distributed and tightly packed on the surface of the chimeric TMV virions. Apparently, the majority of the TMV CP-specific epitopes in the chimeric TMV-M2e particles are hidden from the immune system by the M2e epitopes exposed on the particle surface. The profile of IgG subclasses after immunization of mice with TMV-M2e-ser and TMV-M2e-ala was evaluated. Immunization with TMV-M2e-ala induced a significant difference between the levels of IgG1 and IgG2a (IgG1/IgG2a=3.2). Mice immunized with the chimeric viruses were resistant to five lethal doses (LD50) of the homologous influenza virus strain, A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and TMV-M2e-ala also gave partial protection (5LD50, 70% of survival rate) against a heterologous strain influenza A/California/04/2009 (H1N1) (4 amino acid changes in M2e).

During this biotrophic interaction, plant defense responses are actively suppressed by the pathogen, and previous transcriptome analyses of infected maize plants showed comprehensive and stage-specific changes in host gene expression during disease progression.To identify maize genes that are functionally involved in the interaction with U. maydis, we adapted a VIGS system based on the Brome mosaic virus (BMV) to maize at conditions that allow successful U. maydis infection of BMV pre-infected maize plants.

Accordingly, they are not considered harmful for humans. However, a few studies questioned the certainty of this paradigm. Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA has been detected in human samples and TMV RNA translation has been described in animal cells. We sought to determine if TMV is detectable, persists, and remains viable in the lung tissues of mice following intratracheal inoculation, and we attempted to inoculate mouse macrophages with TMV. In the animal model, mice were intratracheally inoculated with 10(11) viral particles and were sacrificed at different time points. The virus was detected in the mouse lungs using immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, real-time RT-PCR and sequencing, and its viability was studied with an infectivity assay on plants. In the cellular model, the culture medium of murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) was inoculated with different concentrations of TMV, and the virus was detected with real-time RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. In addition, anti-TMV antibodies were detected in mouse sera with ELISA. We showed that infectious TMV could enter and persist in mouse lungs via the intratracheal route. Over 14 days, the TMV RNA level decreased by 5 log(10) copies/ml in the mouse lungs and by 3.5 log(10) in macrophages recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage. TMV was localized to lung tissue, and its infectivity was observed on plants until 3 days after inoculation. In addition, anti-TMV antibody seroconversions were observed in the sera from mice 7 days after inoculation. In the cellular model, we observed that TMV persisted over 15 days after inoculation and it was visualized in the cytoplasm of the BMDM.

Microtubules and associated motor proteins play important roles in these processes in animal systems, and may also play a role in plants. Although transport processes in plants are mostly actin based, studies, in particular with Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and its movement protein (MP), indicate direct or indirect roles of microtubules in the cell-to-cell spread of infection. Detailed observations suggest that microtubules participate in the cortical anchorage of viral replication complexes, in guiding their trafficking along the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/actin network, and also in developing the complexes into virus factories. Microtubules also play a role in the plant-to-plant transmission of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) by assisting in the development of specific virus-induced inclusions that facilitate viral uptake by aphids. The involvement of microtubules in the formation of virus factories and of other virus-induced inclusions suggests the existence of aggresomal pathways by which plant cells recruit membranes and proteins into localized macromolecular assemblies. Although studies related to the involvement of microtubules in the interaction of viruses with plants focus on specific virus models, a number of observations with other virus species suggest that microtubules may have a widespread role in viral pathogenesis.

Potyviruses, the largest group of known plant viruses, comprise many agriculturally important viruses, such as Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV). The potyviral genome encodes 11 mature proteins. To investigate if SUMOylation plays a role in potyvirus infection, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to examine possible interactions of each of the 11 viral proteins of TuMV with AtSCE1, the only SUMO-conjugating enzyme in Arabidopsis thaliana homologous to the key SUMO-conjugating enzyme E2 in mammalian cells or Ubc9 in yeast. A positive reaction was found between AtSCE1 and NIb, the potyviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Further bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays revealed that the NIb and AtSCE1 interaction occurred in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of epidermal cells of Nicotiana benthamiana. The interaction motif was mapped to a region encompassing NIb amino acids 171 to 300 which contains a potential negatively charged amino acid-dependent SUMOylation motif (NDSM). An Escherichia coli SUMOylation assay showed that NIb can be SUMOylated and that the lysine residue (K172) in the motif is a potent SUMOylation site. A TuMV infectious clone with an arginine (R) substitution mutation at K172 compromised TuMV infectivity in plants. In comparison with wild-type Arabidopsis plants, sce1 knockdown plants exhibited increased resistance to TuMV as well as a nonrelated RNA virus.

The timing of the HR is consistent with the upregulation of N gene transcript 4-6 days after sowing. The expression of p50 has a stimulating effect on the N gene transcript level during germination.

In a screen for candidate genes stimulating cell death in Glycine max (soybean), we transiently overexpressed full-length cDNAs of soybean genes that are highly induced during soybean rust infection in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Overexpression of a type-III DnaJ domain-containing HSP40 (GmHSP40.1), a co-chaperone of HSP70, caused hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death. The HR-like cell death was dependent on MAPKKKÎ± and WIPK, because silencing each of these genes suppressed the HR. Consistent with the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) motif within the GmHSP40.1 coding sequence, GFP-GmHSP40.1 was exclusively present in nuclear bodies or speckles. Nuclear localization of GmHSP40.1 was necessary for its function, because deletion of the NLS or addition of a nuclear export signal abolished its HR-inducing ability. GmHSP40.1 co-localized with HcRed-SE, a protein involved in pri-miRNA processing, which has been shown to be co-localized with SR33-YFP, a protein involved in pre-mRNA splicing, suggesting a possible role for GmHSP40.1 in mRNA splicing or miRNA processing, and a link between these processes and cell death. Silencing GmHSP40.1 enhanced the susceptibility of soybean plants to Soybean mosaic virus, confirming its positive role in pathogen defense.

C5a has not been expressed in plants before and is highly unstable in vivo in its native form, so it was necessary to establish the most suitable subcellular targeting strategy. We used the strong and constitutive CaMV 35S promoter to drive transgene expression and compared three different subcellular compartments. The yields of C5a in the T(0) transgenic plants were low in terms of the proportion of total soluble protein (TSP) when targeted to the apoplast (0.0002% TSP) or endoplasmic reticulum (0.0003% TSP) but was one order of magnitude higher when targeted to the vacuole (0.001% TSP). The yields could be increased by conventional breeding (up to 0.014% TSP in the Tâ generation). C5a accumulated to the same level in seeds and leaves when targeted to the apoplast but was up to 1.7-fold more abundant in the seeds when targeted to the ER or vacuole, although this difference was less striking in the better-performing lines. When yields were calculated as an amount per gram fresh weight of transgenic plant tissue, the vacuole targeting strategy was clearly more efficient in seeds, reaching 35.8 Âµg C5a per gram of fresh seed weight compared to 10.62 Âµg C5a per gram fresh weight of leaves. Transient expression of C5aER and C5aVac in N. benthamiana, using MagnICON vectors, reached up to 0.2% and 0.7% of TSP, respectively, but was accompanied by cytotoxic effects and induced leaf senescence.

The percentage of symptomatic plants was 5-10% and, only in particular cases of advanced stage of cultivation, it reached 30-50% at the end of cycle. All TSWV isolates induced similar systemic symptoms in all resistant infected pepper hybrids: yellowing or browning of apical leaves, which later become necrotic, long necrotic streakson stems, extending to the terminal shoots, complete necrosis of younger fruits and large necrotic streaks and spots on fruits formed after infection. On ripe fruits, yellow spots with concentric rings or necrotic streaks could be observed. Leaf extracts of these samples were tested in ELISA for the detection of TSWV, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), Potato virus Y (PVY), Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and Pepper Mottle Virus (PepMoV). Only TSWV was detected in all the field samples tested. The correspondent virus isolates were inoculated mechanically and by Frankliniella occidentalis on to a set of different pepper and tomato hybrids, as well as on some herbaceous test plants, in order to investigate for their ability to overcome the resistance genes Tsw and Sw5, respectively. Tomato hybrids carrying the Sw5 gene were uninfected by all RB isolates, whereas all resistant pepper hybrids became systemically infected. RB isolates did not differ noticeably in transmission efficiency when they were tested with the thrips F. occidentalis. Obtained results demonstrate that evolved strains of TSWV have emerged, that they are able to overcome the Tsw resistance gene in pepper plants experimentally inoculated both by mechanical infection and by the vector F. accidentalis. Moreover, evolved strains, here indicated as TSWV-RB-PI (Pepper, Italy), are not able to infect tomato plants carrying the Sw5 gene, confirming that distinct viral gene products control the outcome of infection in plants carrying Sw5 and Tsw. The simultaneous presence of evolved TSWV strains, showing the same biological characteristics (such as host range and symptomatology on different hosts) in two geographic areas of southern Italy, very far each other, let us hypothesize a unique focus of infection. Only subsequently, infected plants, through trade of plant material, have been diffused in locations so far apart.

Particularly, a eIF(iso)4E family member is required for Arabidopsis thaliana susceptibility to Turnip mosaic virus, Lettuce mosaic virus, and Tobacco etch virus (TEV). In addition, a resistance mechanism named restriction of TEV movement (RTM) in A. thaliana controls the systemic spread of TEV in Col-0 ecotype. Here, we describe that TEV-TAMPS, a Mexican isolate, overcomes the RTM resistance mechanism reported for TEV-7DA infection of the Col-0 ecotype but depends on eIF(iso)4E for its systemic spread. To understand at which level eIF(iso)4E participates in A. thaliana TEV-TAMPS infection, the viral RNA replication and translation were measured. The absence or overexpression of eIF(iso)4E did not affect viral translation, and replication was still observed in the absence of eIF(iso)4E. However, the TEV-TAMPS systemic spread was completely abolished in the null mutant. The viral protein genome-linked (VPg) precursor NIa was found in coimmunoprecipitated complexes with both, eIF(iso)4E and eIF4E. However, the viral coat protein (CP) was only present in the eIF(iso)4E complexes.

However, for commercial applications high amounts of peptide are necessary. The synthetic production of peptides is still quite expensive and, depending on the physico-chemical features, difficult. Therefore we developed a plant/tobacco mosaic virus-based production system following the 'full virus vector strategy' with the viral coat protein as fusion partner for the designed antimicrobial peptide. Infection of Nicotiana benthamiana plants with such recombinant virus resulted in production of huge amounts of virus particles presenting the peptides all over their surface. After extraction of recombinant virions, peptides were released from the coat protein by chemical cleavage. A protocol for purification of the antimicrobial peptides using high resolution chromatographic methods has been established. Finally, we yielded up to 0.025 mg of peptide per g of infected leaf biomass. Mass spectrometric and NMR analysis revealed that the in planta produced peptide differs from the synthetic version only in missing of N-terminal amidation.

We isolated three genes (MsFPPS, MsGPPS and MsGGPPS) encoding isoprenyl diphosphate synthases (IDS) from alfalfa via a homology-based PCR approach. The enzyme activity assay of purified recombined MsFPPS and MsGGPPS expressed in Escherichia coli indicated that they all had IDS activity. Expression analysis of the three genes in different alfalfa tissues using real time PCR displayed that they were expressed in all tissues although they had a different expression patterns. MsFPPS and MsGPS displayed a significant increase in transcript level in response to methyl jasmonate, but the transcript level of MsGGPPS decreased obviously. To elucidate the functions of the three IDSs, their overexpression driven by a constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus-35S promoter in tobacco plants was applied and analyzed. The T(0) transgenic plants of MsFPPS showed high levels of squalene content when compared with control. However, no differences were detected in T(0) transgenic plants of MsGPPS and MsGGPPS. In addition, the overexpression of MsFPPS induced senescence response in transgenic plant leaves.

Pressure-induced dissociation of viral particles involves a reduction in the Gibbs free energy of dissociation and a negative change in volume. In this work, we investigated the combined effect of high pressure and temperature on the dissociation of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). We assumed the presence of two states of TMV with different tendencies to dissociate. Thus one form presents a low tendency (L) and the other a high tendency (H) to dissociate. Based on the model described here, the L-H transition was favored by an increase in pressure and a decrease in temperature. The volume change of dissociation was pressure- and temperature-dependent, with a highly negative value of -80 mL/mol being recorded at 0 Â°C and atmospheric pressure. The entropy and enthalpy of dissociation were very temperature- and pressure-dependent, with values of entropy of 450 to -1300 kJ/mol and values of enthalpy of 5.5 Ã 10(4) to 2.4 Ã 10(4) kJ/mol.

K. indica is believed to have a clearing effect on eyesight, reduces blood pressure and swelling, and is rich in carotene, which can reduce internal heat, enhancing human immunity. It also grows as a weed around tobacco fields and can transmit viruses to tobacco. In June of 2012, we observed diffuse chlorotic and necrotic spots on the leaves of K. indica in the field in Liaoning Province. Sap extracts from symptomatic plants were tested by direct antigen coated ELISA using polyclonal antibodies specific to Potato virus Y (PVY), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Samples were negative for CMV and TMV but positive for PVY.

1546,30727266,Plant disease,First Report of Tomato ringspot virus Infecting Pepper in Iran.,10.1094/PDIS-07-12-0664-PDN,"Chili pepper (Capsicum frutescens) represents an important crop in Iran and is under cultivation in different regions in Northern Iran. In spring 2012, commercially grown tabasco (Capsicum frutescens) peppers in Varamin, Shahriar, and Karaj districts of Tehran province developed an undescribed disease. Symptoms observed were mosaic, leaf malformations, and stunting. Fruit symptoms included chlorosis and distortion. To verify the identity of the disease, six fields were surveyed and 72 symptomatic leaves were collected and screened by double antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA using specific antibodies to Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV), Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMV), Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), and Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV). ToRSV was found in 23% of the samples collected. None of the samples had a positive reaction to other tested viruses. The ToRSV-positive peppers were used for mechanical transmission to Chenopodium quinoa, local lesion host, and after two cycles of single local lesion isolation, they were transferred to Cucumis sativus, Solanum esculentum, and Capsicum fructescens. Inoculations resulted in systemic mosaic and chlorotic local lesion on C. sativus; leaf distortion and mosaic on S. esculentum; and mosaic, mottle, and stunting on C. fructescens. All inoculated plants were positive for ToRSV with DAS-ELISA. To further verify ToRSV infection, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was conducted. Two primers were designed on the basis of the highly conserved sequences of the putative viral polymerase gene available in the GenBank. RT-PCR of total RNA extract from infected peppers and inoculated plants with the designed primers RdR-R (5'-CGCCTGGTAATTGAGTAGCCC-3') and RdR-F (5'-GAAGAGCTAGAGCCTCAACCAGG-3'), consistently amplified the 411-bp product, while no amplification products were obtained from noninfected control (healthy plants). The fragment from tabasco pepper was cloned into pTZ57R/T (Ins T/A clone PCR Cloning kit, Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and sequenced in both directions of three clones. The resulting nucleotide sequence (GenBank Accession No. JQ972695) had the highest identity (94%) with the polymerase gene of a ToRSV isolate from blueberry cv. Patriot (Accession No. GQ141528) and had lower identity (91%) with that of a ToRSV isolate from blueberry cv. Bluecrop (Accession No. GQ141525). Tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV) is reported to infect Capsicum spp. in the United States (1,2). Our results confirm the natural infection of pepper plants in Tehran by ToRSV. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ToRSV infection of pepper in Iran. The finding of this disease in Tehran confirms further spread of the virus within northern regions of Iran and prompts the need for research to develop more effective management options to reduce the impact of ToRSV on pepper crops. Beside, primers designed on the basis of putative viral polymerase gene sequences may improve the detection of ToRSV isolates by RT-PCR in Iran. References: (1) S. K. Green and J. S. Kim.

Here, we have investigated the properties of the Y-shaped class of 3'CITE present in the tombusvirus Carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV). While some types of 3'CITE have been found to function through recruitment of translation initiation factors to the viral genome, no trans-acting translation-related factors have yet been identified for the Y-shaped 3'CITE. Our results indicate that the CIRV 3'CITE complexes with eIF4F and eIFiso4F, with the former mediating translation more efficiently than the latter. In nature, some classes of 3'CITE are present in several different viral genera, suggesting that these elements hold a high degree of modularity. Here, we test this concept by engineering chimeric viruses containing heterologous 3'CITEs and show that the Y-shaped class of 3'CITE in CIRV can be replaced by two alternative types of 3'CITE, i.e., a Panicum mosaic virus-like 3'CITE or an I-shaped 3'CITE, without any major loss in in vitro translation or replication efficiency in protoplasts. The heterologous 3'CITEs also mediated whole-plant infections of Nicotiana benthamiana, where distinct symptoms were observed for each of the alternative 3'CITEs and 3'CITE evolution occurred during serial passaging.

Currently, a number of different nanoparticles are being investigated for applications in imaging and therapy. Viral nanoparticles (VNPs) derived from plants can be regarded as self-assembled bionanomaterials with defined sizes and shapes. Plant viruses under investigation in the Steinmetz lab include icosahedral particles formed by Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) and Brome mosaic virus (BMV), both of which are 30 nm in diameter. We are also developing rod-shaped and filamentous structures derived from the following plant viruses: Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), which forms rigid rods with dimensions of 300 nm by 18 nm, and Potato virus X (PVX), which form filamentous particles 515 nm in length and 13 nm in width (the reader is referred to refs. (1) and (2) for further information on VNPs). From a materials scientist's point of view, VNPs are attractive building blocks for several reasons: the particles are monodisperse, can be produced with ease on large scale in planta, are exceptionally stable, and biocompatible. Also, VNPs are ""programmable"" units, which can be specifically engineered using genetic modification or chemical bioconjugation methods. The structure of VNPs is known to atomic resolution, and modifications can be carried out with spatial precision at the atomic level, a level of control that cannot be achieved using synthetic nanomaterials with current state-of-the-art technologies. In this paper, we describe the propagation of CPMV, PVX, TMV, and BMV in Vigna ungiuculata and Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Extraction and purification protocols for each VNP are given. Methods for characterization of purified and chemically-labeled VNPs are described. In this study, we focus on chemical labeling of VNPs with fluorophores (e.g. Alexa Fluor 647) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The dyes facilitate tracking and detection of the VNPs, and PEG reduces immunogenicity of the proteinaceous nanoparticles while enhancing their pharmacokinetics. We demonstrate tumor homing of PEGylated VNPs using a mouse xenograft tumor model. A combination of fluorescence imaging of tissues ex vivo using Maestro Imaging System, fluorescence quantification in homogenized tissues, and confocal microscopy is used to study biodistribution. VNPs are cleared via the reticuloendothelial system (RES); tumor homing is achieved passively via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The VNP nanotechnology is a powerful plug-and-play technology to image and treat sites of disease in vivo. We are further developing VNPs to carry drug cargos and clinically-relevant imaging moieties, as well as tissue-specific ligands to target molecular receptors overexpressed in cancer and cardiovascular disease.",eng,2012,11,16,2012,11,28,epublish,"Animals|Bromovirus|Colonic Neoplasms|Comovirus|Fabaceae|HT29 Cells|Humans|Mice|Mice, Nude|Microscopy, Electron, Transmission|Nanoparticles|Plant Viruses|Potexvirus|Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D000818|D017795|D003110|D017798|D007887|D019073|D006801|D051379|D008819|D046529|D053758|D010942|D017863|D013056|D014026|D014027,

Previously, we produced transgenic tobacco plants with increased tolerance to water stress by overexpressing the wheat expansin gene TaEXPB23 driven by the constitutive 35S cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter. However, the growth and development of 35S::TaEXPB23 transgenic tobacco plants were altered under normal growth conditions, with a faster growth rate at the seedling stage, earlier flowering and maturation, and a shorter plant height compared to WT. In the current study, we determined that cellular characteristics and carbohydrate metabolism were altered in 35S::TaEXPB23 transgenic tobacco plants. We also generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants using the same vector. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants had the same phenotype as the transgenic tobacco plants, which may have resulted from the altered expression of several flowering-related genes. We then produced TaEXPB23 transgenic tobacco plants using the stress-inducible RD29A promoter. The use of this promoter reduced the negative effects of TaEXPB23 on plant growth and development. The RD29A::TaEXPB23 transgenic tobacco plants had greater tolerance to water stress than WT, as determined by examining physiological and biochemical parameters. Therefore, the use of stress-inducible promoters, such as RD29A, may minimize the negative effects of constitutive transgene expression and improve the water-stress tolerance of plants.",eng,2012,11,23,2012,11,28,ppublish,"Arabidopsis|Arabidopsis Proteins|Carbohydrate Metabolism|Dehydration|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Phenotype|Plant Proteins|Plants, Genetically Modified|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Tobacco|Triticum|Water",D017360|D029681|D050260|D003681|D018506|D010641|D010940|D030821|D011401|D014026|D014908|D014867,

Our data suggest that CDC48 participates in the clearance of these viral protein inclusions in an ER-assisted protein degradation (ERAD)-like mechanism. As TMV MP-inclusions formed at late infection stages resemble aggresomes, we here propose that TMV MP enters both, ERAD-like and aggresomal pathways in its host cells and that CDC48 coordinates these processes. Moreover, as viruses often exploit host pathways for replication and spread, we propose a model in which CDC48 functions in the degradation pathway of overaccumulating viral protein and also actively participates in the regulation of TMV replication and cell-to-cell movement.Â  ",eng,2012,11,15,2012,11,17,ppublish,Adenosine Triphosphatases|Cell Cycle Proteins|Plant Proteins|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Valosin Containing Protein|Viral Proteins|Virus Replication,D000251|D018797|D010940|D014027|D000074405|D014764|D014779,ER-assisted protein degradation|Tobacco mosaic virus|aggresome|endoplasmic reticulum|microtubules|protein inclusion|replication complex|virus infection

Among these viruses, members of the genus Ilarvirus (isometric labile ringspot viruses) occupy a significant position due to their distribution worldwide. Although symptoms caused by these types of viruses were reported early in the last century, their molecular characterization was not achieved until the 1990s, much later than for other agronomically relevant viruses. This was mainly due to the characteristic liability of virus particles in tissue extracts. In addition, ilarviruses, together with Alfalfa mosaic virus, are unique among plant viruses in that they require a few molecules of the coat protein in the inoculum in order to be infectious, a phenomenon known as genome activation. Another factor that has made the study of this group of viruses difficult is that infectious clones have been obtained only for the type member of the genus, Tobacco streak virus.

In susceptible N. benthamiana plants, silencing of NbRbCS enabled ToMV to induce necrosis in inoculated leaves, thus enhancing virus local infectivity. However, the development of systemic viral symptoms was delayed. In transgenic N. benthamiana plants harboring Tobacco mosaic virus resistance-2Â² (Tm-2Â²), which mediates extreme resistance to ToMV, silencing of NbRbCS compromised Tm-2Â²-dependent resistance.

The crystal structure of the homologue Tomato aspermy virus (TAV) 2b protein is known, but without the C-terminal domain. The biologically active form is a tetramer: four 2b protein molecules and two siRNA duplexes. Regarding the complete 2b protein structure, we performed a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the whole siRNA-2b ribonucleoprotein complex. Unfortunately, the C-terminal domain is proved to be partially unstructured. Multiple sequence alignment showed a well conserved motif between residues 94 and 105. The negatively charged residues of the C-terminal domain are supposed to take part in coordination of a divalent metal ion and stabilize the three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal domain. MD simulations were performed on the detached C-terminal domains (aa 65-110). 0.15 M MgCâ, CaClâ, FeClâ and ZnClâ salt concentrations were used in the screening simulations.

A quadruple mutation (Rs2DDTD/95-98/AAAA) was introduced into the position of the putative divalent metal ion binding site to analyze the biological relevance of molecular modeling derived hypothesis.

Here we present an alternate strategy that harnesses the avidity effect to overcome this limitation. Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), a plant virus relevant to drug delivery applications, was chosen as a model target for this study. An RCNMV binding protein (RBP) with modest binding affinity (K(D) ~100 nM) was generated through mutagenesis of the Sso7d protein from Sulfolobus solfataricus and used as the affinity ligand. In our separation scheme, RCNMV is captured by a highly avid interaction with RBP immobilized on a nickel surface through a hexahistidine (6xHis) tag. Subsequently, disruption of the multivalent interaction and release of RCNMV is achieved by elution of RBP from the nickel surface. Finally, RCNMV is separated from RBP by exploiting the large difference in their molecular weights (~8 MDa vs. ~10 kDa). Our strategy not only eliminates the need for harsh elution conditions, but also bypasses chemical conjugation of the affinity ligand to the capture surface. Stable non-antibody affinity ligands to a wide spectrum of targets can be generated through mutagenesis of Sso7d and other hyperthermophilic proteins. Therefore, our approach may be broadly relevant to cases where capture of large multivalent species from complex mixtures and subsequent release without the use of harsh elution conditions is necessary.",eng,2012,12,04,2012,11,6,ppublish,Archaeal Proteins|DNA-Binding Proteins|Ligands|Molecular Weight|Plant Extracts|Plant Leaves|Sulfolobus solfataricus|Tobacco|Tombusviridae,D019843|D004268|D008024|D008970|D010936|D018515|D048229|D014026|D019183,

Two primer sets, one optimal (ÎGÂ =Â 0) and one sub-optimal (ÎGÂ =Â 0.9), were designed using web interface software Primer3, BLASTn, and mFold to target a movement protein gene of Tobacco mosaic virus.

Greater fluorescence was obtained using optimal primers compared to that with sub-optimal primers. Primers designed with sub-optimal thermodynamics can be substantially improved by adding 5' flaps. Results indicate that even if the performance of some primers can be improved substantially by 5' flap addition, not all primers will be similarly improved.

During a cucurbit survey in the summer of 2010, severe mosaic and mottling symptoms were observed on many peppers (Capsicum annuum) and white clover (Trifolium repens) plants in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Symptomatic leaf samples from 15 pepper and two white clover plants were collected in the Bixby area and analyzed serologically by dot-immunobinding assay (DIBA) using specific polyclonal antibodies against AMV (Agdia, Inc). Seven out of 15 pepper samples and both white clover samples were tested positive by DIBA to AMV. The remaining symptomatic samples were positive to Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Total RNA was extracted from DIBA positive AMV samples by Tri-reagent method. A small aliquot of total RNA was tested by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using specific primers: AMV-F 5' GTCCGCGATCTCTTAAAT 3' and AMV-R 5' GAAGTTTGGGTCGAGAGA 3' that were designed to amplify 900 bp of the AMV-RNA 3. Analysis of the PCR products on agarose gel electrophoreses showed that all tested samples showed a band of the expected size while DIBA negative AMV samples did not produce any band. The amplified PCR product (900 bp) obtained from pepper and white clover were cleaned with PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) and directly sequenced bi-directionally using the above primers. Sequence analysis confirmed that this virus shared 97% identity at nucleotide sequence with RNA 3 of AMV isolate from Madison-USA (GenBank Accession No. K02703).

Little is known about the biology and pathological properties of GRSPaV. In this work, we engineered a full-length infectious cDNA clone for GRSPaV and a GFP-tagged variant, both under the transcriptional control of Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. We demonstrated that these cDNA clones were infectious in grapevines and Nicotiana benthamiana through fluorescence microscopy, RT-PCR, Western blotting and immuno electron microscopy. Interestingly, GRSPaV does not cause systemic infection in four of the most commonly used herbaceous plants, even in the presence of the movement proteins of two other viruses which are known to complement numerous movement-defective viruses.

Virus infection induces the remodeling of intracellular membranes. Virus-induced membrane structures are thought to increase the local concentration of the components that are required for replication and provide a scaffold for tethering the replicase complexes. However, the mechanisms underlying virus-induced membrane remodeling are poorly understood. RNA replication of red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), a positive-strand RNA plant virus, is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, and ER morphology is perturbed in RCNMV-infected cells. Here, we identified ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) in the affinity-purified RCNMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase fraction. Arf1 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous, small GTPase that is implicated in the formation of the coat protein complex I (COPI) vesicles on Golgi membranes. Using in vitro pulldown and bimolecular fluorescence complementation analyses, we showed that Arf1 interacted with the viral p27 replication protein within the virus-induced large punctate structures of the ER membrane. We found that inhibition of the nucleotide exchange activity of Arf1 using the inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) disrupted the assembly of the viral replicase complex and p27-mediated ER remodeling. We also showed that BFA treatment and the expression of dominant negative Arf1 mutants compromised RCNMV RNA replication in protoplasts. Interestingly, the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Sar1, a key regulator of the biogenesis of COPII vesicles at ER exit sites, also compromised RCNMV RNA replication. These results suggest that the replication of RCNMV depends on the host membrane traffic machinery.",eng,2012,10,24,2012,10,26,ppublish,ADP-Ribosylation Factor 1|Arabidopsis|Centrifugation|Endoplasmic Reticulum|Fluorescence|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Protein Binding|Protein Interaction Mapping|Tobacco|Tombusviridae|Viral Proteins|Virus Replication,D020823|D017360|D002498|D004721|D005453|D054884|D011485|D025941|D014026|D019183|D014764|D014779,

In this study, CYVMV (genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae) was transmitted by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) to as many as 35 plant species belonging to 11 families, including many vegetables, tobacco varieties, ornamentals and weeds. CYVMV produced bright yellow vein symptoms in croton, whereas in all the other host species, the virus produced leaf curl symptoms. CYVMV produced leaf curl in 13 tobacco species and 22 cultivars of Nicotiana tabacum and resembled tobacco leaf curl virus (TobLCV) in host reactions. However, CYVMV was distinguished from TobLCV in four differential hosts, Ageratum conyzoides, C. bonplandianum, Euphorbia geniculata and Sonchus bracyotis. The complete genome sequences of four isolates originating from northern, eastern and southern India revealed that a single species of DNA-A and a betasatellite, croton yellow vein mosaic betasatellite (CroYVMB) were associated with the yellow vein mosaic disease of croton. The sequence identity among the isolates of CYVMV DNA-A and CroYVMB occurring in diverse plant species was 91.8-97.9 % and 83.3-100 %, respectively. The CYVMV DNA-A and CroYVMB generated through rolling-circle amplification of the cloned DNAs produced typical symptoms of yellow vein mosaic and leaf curling in croton and tomato, respectively.

To identify host proteins that interact with individual viral components of VRCs or VRCs in toto, we isolated viral replicase- and VRC-enriched fractions from TMV-infected Nicotiana tabacum plants. Two host proteins in enriched fractions, ATP-synthase Î³-subunit (AtpC) and Rubisco activase (RCA) were identified by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Through pull-down analysis, RCA bound predominantly to the region between the methyltransferase and helicase domains of the TMV replicase. Tobamovirus, but not Cucumber mosaic virus or Potato virus X, infection of N. tabacum plants resulted in 50% reductions in Rca and AtpC messenger RNA levels. To investigate the role of these host proteins in TMV accumulation and plant defense, we used a Tobacco rattle virus vector to silence these genes in Nicotiana benthamiana plants prior to challenge with TMV expressing green fluorescent protein. TMV-induced fluorescent lesions on Rca- or AtpC-silenced leaves were, respectively, similar or twice the size of those on leaves expressing these genes. Silencing Rca and AtpC did not influence the spread of Tomato bushy stunt virus and Potato virus X. In AtpC- and Rca-silenced leaves TMV accumulation and pathogenicity were greatly enhanced, suggesting a role of both host-encoded proteins in a defense response against TMV. In addition, silencing these host genes altered the phenotype of the TMV infection foci and VRCs, yielding foci with concentric fluorescent rings and dramatically more but smaller VRCs.

Here we demonstrate that P6 additionally acts as a pathogenicity effector of an unique and novel type, modifying NPR1 (a key regulator of salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent signaling) and inhibiting SA-dependent defence responses We find that that transgene-mediated expression of P6 in Arabidopsis and transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana has profound effects on defence signaling, suppressing expression of representative SA-responsive genes and increasing expression of representative JA-responsive genes. Relative to wild-type Arabidopsis P6-expressing transgenics had greatly reduced expression of PR-1 following SA-treatment, infection by CaMV or inoculation with an avirulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst). Similarly transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana of P6 (including a mutant form defective in translational transactivation activity) suppressed PR-1a transcript accumulation in response to Agrobacterium infiltration and following SA-treatment. As well as suppressing the expression of representative SA-regulated genes, P6-transgenic Arabidopsis showed greatly enhanced susceptibility to both virulent and avirulent Pst (titres elevated 10 to 30-fold compared to non-transgenic controls) but reduced susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. Necrosis following SA-treatment or inoculation with avirulent Pst was reduced and delayed in P6-transgenics. NPR1 an important regulator of SA/JA crosstalk, was more highly expressed in the presence of P6 and introduction of the P6 transgene into a transgenic line expressing an NPR1:GFP fusion resulted in greatly increased fluorescence in nuclei even in the absence of SA. Thus in the presence of P6 an inactive form of NPR1 is mislocalized in the nucleus even in uninduced plants.

Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing OsLCBK1 were generated and disease resistance assays indicate that the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants showed enhanced disease resistance against Pseudmonas syringae pv. tabacci, the causal agent of wildfire disease, and tobacco mosaic virus. Expression levels of some defense-related genes were constitutively up-regulated and further induced after pathogen infection in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants. Treatment with fungal toxin fumonisin B1, an effective inducer of PCD in plants, resulted in reduced level of cell death in the OsLCBK1-overexpressing plants, as indicated by cell death staining, leakage of electrolyte and expression of hypersensitive response indicator genes.

Site-specific mutations in the ORF6 protein were made, hybrid ORF6 proteins were created in which the N-terminal and C-terminal parts were derived from the two proteins, and different subregions of the protein were examined, using expression either from a recombinant TRV vector or as a yellow fluorescent protein fusion from a binary plasmid in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. L-ORF6 caused mild necrotic symptoms in Nicotiana benthamiana when expressed from TRV, whereas U1-ORF6 caused severe symptoms including death of the plant apex. The difference in symptoms was associated with the C-terminal region of L-ORF6, which directed the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas U1-ORF6 was directed initially to the nucleolus and later to the mitochondria.

The recent release of the draft genome sequence for N. benthamiana consolidates its role as a model for plant-pathogen interactions.

For valid qPCR analysis, accurate normalisation of gene expression against an appropriate internal control is required. Yet there has been little systematic investigation of reference gene stability in N. benthamiana under conditions of viral infections.

In addition, the suitability of PP2A, F-BOX and L23 as reference genes was illustrated by expression-level analysis of AGO2 and RdR6 in virus-infected N. benthamiana leaves. This is the first study to systematically examine and evaluate the stability of different reference genes in N. benthamiana.

The movement process involves interactions of MP with the ER and the cytoskeleton as well as its targeting to PD. Later in the infection cycle, the MP further accumulates and localizes to ER-associated inclusions, the viral factories, and along microtubules before it is finally degraded. Although these patterns of MP accumulation have been described in great detail, the underlying mechanisms that control MP fate and function during infection are not known. Here, we identify CELL-DIVISION-CYCLE protein48 (CDC48), a conserved chaperone controlling protein fate in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and animal cells by extracting protein substrates from membranes or complexes, as a cellular factor regulating MP accumulation patterns in plant cells. We demonstrate that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CDC48 is induced upon infection, interacts with MP in ER inclusions dependent on the MP N terminus, and promotes degradation of the protein. We further provide evidence that CDC48 extracts MP from ER inclusions to the cytosol, where it subsequently accumulates on and stabilizes microtubules. We show that virus movement is impaired upon overexpression of CDC48, suggesting that CDC48 further functions in controlling virus movement by removal of MP from the ER transport pathway and by promoting interference of MP with microtubule dynamics. CDC48 acts also in response to other proteins expressed in the ER, thus suggesting a general role of CDC48 in ER membrane maintenance upon ER stress.",eng,2012,10,01,2012,10,3,ppublish,ATPases Associated with Diverse Cellular Activities|Arabidopsis|Arabidopsis Proteins|Biomarkers|Cell Cycle Proteins|Endoplasmic Reticulum|Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress|Green Fluorescent Proteins|Inclusion Bodies|Plant Diseases|Plant Viral Movement Proteins|Protein Binding|Protein Transport|Proteolysis|Recombinant Fusion Proteins|Subcellular Fractions|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D000074183|D017360|D029681|D015415|D018797|D004721|D059865|D049452|D002479|D010935|D053830|D011485|D021381|D059748|D011993|D013347|D014026|D014027,

Considering tests on t-PMEP, MPA treatment of samples induced membrane depolarization and this effect was greater in healthy samples compared to infected ones. In any case, complete repolarization was achieved, indicating no irreversible damage to the membrane due to MPA administration. Moreover, in samples pre-treated with MPA, the extent of depolarization caused by Fe(3+) administration was lower than in samples without pre-treatment but the MPA effect was not related to virus infection. With regard to tests on t-PMET, MPA caused a reduction in Fe(3+)/Fe(2+) conversion compared to untreated plants. However, infected samples were less sensitive to MPA treatment, which may be due to the concurrent entry of MPA within the symplast that, as indicated by t-PMEP tests, was lower in infected samples. In conclusion, MPA interferes with membrane activity linked to NAD(+)/NADH conversion, acting differently in infected or healthy samples during drug uptake by cells.",eng,2012,08,18,2012,9,1,ppublish,Analysis of Variance|Antiviral Agents|Cell Membrane|Cucumovirus|Electron Transport|Enzyme Inhibitors|Membrane Potentials|Mycophenolic Acid|NAD|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Tobacco,D000704|D000998|D002462|D017799|D004579|D004791|D008564|D009173|D009243|D010935|D018515|D014026,

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. In this study, we used a model virus, Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), whose replicase complex can be detected readily as the 480-kDa functional protein complex. We found that host heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90 are required for RCNMV RNA replication and that they interact with p27, a virus-encoded component of the 480-kDa replicase complex, on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Using a cell-free viral translation/replication system in combination with specific inhibitors of Hsp70 and Hsp90, we found that inhibition of p27-Hsp70 interaction inhibits the formation of the 480-kDa complex but instead induces the accumulation of large complexes that are nonfunctional in viral RNA synthesis. In contrast, inhibition of p27-Hsp90 interaction did not induce such large complexes but rendered p27 incapable of binding to a specific viral RNA element, which is a critical step for the assembly of the 480-kDa replicase complex and viral RNA replication. Together, our results suggest that Hsp70 and Hsp90 regulate different steps in the assembly of the RCNMV replicase complex.",eng,2012,08,29,2012,8,31,ppublish,"Cloning, Molecular|Endoplasmic Reticulum|Gene Silencing|HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins|HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins|Microscopy, Confocal|Plants|Protein Binding|Protein Biosynthesis|RNA Viruses|RNA, Viral|RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase|Tobacco|Tombusviridae|Virus Replication",D003001|D004721|D020868|D018840|D018841|D018613|D010944|D011485|D014176|D012328|D012367|D012324|D014026|D019183|D014779,

The roles of viral encoded proteins involved in the infection cycle of LCV have not yet been characterized due to the lack of reverse genetic tools. We present here a report of the successful development of an Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation system for the cloned cDNA constructs of LCV. The cDNAs of both LCV RNAs 1 and 2 were engineered into binary vectors in which the expression of LCV RNAs was regulated under a Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter. In addition, by engineering the sequence elements of the Hepatitis delta virus ribozyme and the nopaline synthase 3' untranslated region immediately downstream of the last nucleotide of LCV RNAs 1 and 2 in the binary vector constructs, the in planta produced LCV transcripts were expected to bear authentic 3' termini. Both constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells and infiltrated in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. Three to four weeks post-agroinoculation, the N. benthamiana plants developed typical interveinal chlorosis and LCV infection was detected in the systemic leaves by reverse transcription-PCR. Virions purified from the LCV-infected N. benthamiana plants were flexuous rod-shaped and were transmissible by both B. tabaci biotypes A and B following membrane feeding. These results support the conclusion that Agrobacterium-mediated inoculation of LCV binary vectors in N. benthamiana plants results in LCV infection and the production of biologically active, whitefly transmissible virions.

Ubiquitin are involved in the production, metabolism and proper function of gibberellin. The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system (UPS), in which ubiquitin (Ub) functions as a marker, is a post-translational regulatory system that plays a prominent role in various biological processes. To investigate the impact of different Ub levels on plant growth and development, transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants were engineered to express an Ub gene (TaUb2) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing TaUb2 demonstrated an accelerated growth rate at early stage and an early flowering phenotype in development. The preceding expression of MADS-box genes also corresponded to the accelerated developmental phenotypes of the transgenic tobacco plants compared to that of wild-type (WT). Total gibberellin (GA) and active GA contents in transgenic tobacco plants were higher than those in WT at the corresponding developmental stages, and some GA metabolism genes were upregulated. Treatment with GA(3) conferred a similarly accelerated grown rate in WT plants to that of transgenic tobacco plants, while growth was inhibited when transgenic tobacco plants were treated with a GA biosynthesis inhibitor. Thus, the results suggest that Ub are involved in the production, metabolism and proper function of GA, which is important in the regulation of plant growth and development.",eng,2012,08,29,2012,8,29,ppublish,"Caulimovirus|Flowers|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Genes, Plant|Gibberellins|Phenotype|Plant Leaves|Plant Proteins|Plant Stems|Plants, Genetically Modified|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Time Factors|Tobacco|Triazoles|Triticum|Ubiquitin",D017796|D035264|D018506|D017343|D005875|D010641|D018515|D010940|D018547|D030821|D011401|D013997|D014026|D014230|D014908|D025801,

While four of these enzymes are characterized as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, the nature of a fifth oxidase, GA(4) desaturase (DES), is unknown. DES converts GA(4) to GA(7) by the formation of a carbon-1,2 double bond in the penultimate step of the pathway. Here, we show by expression of the des complementary DNA in Escherichia coli that DES has the characteristics of a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase. Although it has low amino acid sequence homology with known 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, putative iron- and 2-oxoglutarate-binding residues, typical of such enzymes, are apparent in its primary sequence. A survey of sequence databases revealed that homologs of DES are widespread in the ascomycetes, although in most cases the homologs must participate in non-gibberellin (GA) pathways. Expression of des from the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in the plant species Solanum nigrum, Solanum dulcamara, and Nicotiana sylvestris resulted in substantial growth stimulation, with a 3-fold increase in height in S. dulcamara compared with controls. In S. nigrum, the height increase was accompanied by a 20-fold higher concentration of GA(3) in the growing shoots than in controls, although GA(1) content was reduced. Expression of des was also shown to partially restore growth in plants dwarfed by ectopic expression of a GA 2-oxidase (GA-deactivating) gene, consistent with GA(3) being protected from 2-oxidation.

Expression of a series of chimeric constructs between RCY1-HA and RPP8-HA in CMV(Y)-infected N. benthamiana indicated that induction of defense responses to CMV(Y) is regulated by the LRR domain of RCY1. Interestingly, in CMV(Y)-infected N. benthamiana manifesting the defense response, the levels of both RCY1 and chimeric proteins harboring the RCY1 LRR domain were significantly reduced.

Small fractions were collected from the output of the AF4 apparatus for investigation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The influence of CNC injection amount, the number of passes through a high-pressure homogenizer, and different CNC sources on the elution behavior and particle size distribution was investigated. The AF4-MALS results on crystal length were compared with those from TEM. Peak distortion and variation in elution profiles with the increase in sample load were observed. Good resolution was obtained when the injection mass varied from 20 to 40 Î¼g, corresponding to injections of 4-8 Î¼L at a starting concentration of ~5 Î¼g/Î¼L; concentrations during the separation process and at the detector were significantly lower. As the number of homogenization treatments increased, the peak shape became narrower and more symmetrical. This indicates a narrowed crystal length distribution, but regardless of source or homogenization treatment, no CNC preparation was as uniform as tobacco mosaic virus, a well-known rigid rod model structure, whose length was found by AF4-MALS to be in agreement with literature values. CNCs derived from cotton contained longer crystals than those derived from microcrystalline cellulose, as shown by both AF4-MALS and TEM techniques. An advantage of AF4-MALS compared to TEM is the ability to sample large numbers of rodlike particles, which is challenging and time-consuming for TEM image analysis, especially without the presorting afforded by AF4. The good TMV results suggest a high degree of accuracy will pertain to the CNC size distribution measurements.",eng,2012,08,14,2012,8,2,ppublish,"Cellulose|Fractionation, Field Flow|Light|Microscopy, Electron, Transmission|Nanoparticles|Particle Size|Scattering, Radiation",D002482|D031521|D008027|D046529|D053758|D010316|D012542,

ELISAs of extracts of four samples showed that one sample with mosaic symptoms had a positive reaction with Broad bean wilt virus 2 (BBWV-2) monoclonal antibody provided by Professor X. P. Zhou (1). The monoclonal antibody recognized the 44.7 kD coat protein subunit of BBWV-2. We used Chenopodium quinoa as an assay species to isolate the virus by sap transmissions and to maintain the virus strain. Sap from infected C. quinoa, when inoculated onto indicator plant species, induced the following symptoms: C. quinoa: local lesions in inoculated leaves, systemic chlorotic mottle in upper leaves, deformation, and apical necrosis; C. amaranticolor: chlorotic local lesions, systemic mosaic and leaf distortion; Nicotiana benthamiana: systemic mosaic; Gomphrena globosa: local purple spots in inoculated leaves and systemic infection in upper leaves; Tetragonia expansa: local lesions, but no symptoms of systemic infection; Physalis floridana: systemic mosaic. No symptoms were observed on Capsicum annuum, Datura stramonium, N. glutinosa, or N. tabacum cv. White Burley. To confirm BBWV-2 infection, total RNAs extracted from infected C. quinoa leaves were reverse transcripted to cDNA using oligo-dT primer (T17V). The primer pair Fab5'R1F (5'-AAATATTAAAACAAACAGCTTTCGTT-3') and Fab5'R1R (5'-TTCAAAGCTCGTGCCATNTYATTKGC-3') for specific detection of the Fabavirus genus (2) was used for PCR analysis. The amplified fragment is between the 5'-terminal non-translatable region (NTR) and the beginning of the coding region of RNA1. Amplicons of approximately the expected size (~391 bp) were produced from the virus-infected C. quinoa and a BBWV-2 positive control (ATCC PV131, PV0537). Amplicons of approximately the expected size (~350 bp) were produced from the BBWV-1 positive control (ATCC PV132). However, no such amplicons were observed from healthy C. quinoa plants and water control. The 391-bp amplicons of RNA1 obtained from the infected C. quinoa were cloned and sequenced. Comparison with sequences of other BBWV-2 isolates showed that the isolate we obtained (No. JX070674) had approximately 99% nt identity (98% amino acid identity) with Chinese BBWV-2 isolate BC (No. FJ485686.1) (3). As an ornamental and medicinal plant, E. purpurea is widely cultivated in northern China. Up until now, Tomato ring spot virus, Tobacco rattle virus, Cucumber mosaic virus, and Tomato spotted wilt virus have been detected or isolated from E. purpurea in the world (4). To our knowledge, this is the first report of BBWV-2 infecting E. purpurea in China. BBWV-2-infected E. purpurea may have less secondary metabolites, which could influence the quality and therapeutic efficacy of this herbal medicine. References: (1) L. Qing et al.

A method is described for estimating the absolute magnification of an electron micrograph of a frozen-hydrated specimen using horse spleen apoferritin as a standard. Apoferritin is a widely available protein complex of known structure that may be included with the specimen of interest and imaged under conditions identical to those used for imaging other biological specimens by cryomicroscopy. The sum of the structure factor intensities of images of randomly-oriented apoferritin particles shows three low resolution peaks to 25Ã that arise from the hollow ball structure of apoferritin. Comparison of peak positions of the experimental intensities with structure factor intensities of an atomic model of apoferritin determined by X-ray crystallography provides a scale factor for estimating the absolute magnification of the micrograph.

In transient-expression experiments with the GFP-fused P3 protein in epidermal leaf cells of Nicotiana benthamiana, the P3 protein was associated with the nucleus and plasmodesmata. Immunogold-labelling studies of thin sections of RTYV-infected rice plants using an antiserum against Escherichia coli-expressed His(6)-tagged P3 protein indicated that the P3 protein was located in cell walls and on virus particles. In Western blots using antisera against E. coli-expressed P3 protein and purified RTYV, the P3 protein was detected in purified RTYV, whilst antiserum against purified RTYV reacted with the E. coli-expressed P3 protein. After immunogold labelling of crude sap from RTYV-infected rice leaves, the P3 protein, as well as the N protein, was detected on the ribonucleocapsid core that emerged from partially disrupted virus particles.

The copper(I) catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction was highly efficient in covalently linking Tn onto the TMV capsid without resorting to a large excess of the Tn antigen. The location of Tn attachment turned out to be important. Tn introduced at the N terminus of TMV was immunosilent, while that attached to tyrosine 139 elicited strong immune responses. Both Tn specific IgG and IgM antibodies were generated as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a glycan microarray screening study. The production of high titers of IgG antibodies suggested that the TMV platform contained the requisite epitopes for helper T cells and was able to induce antibody isotype switching.

To elucidate the mechanism of RNA depurination, and to understand how PAP recognizes and targets various RNAs, the interactions between PAP and turnip mosaic virus genome-linked protein (VPg) were investigated. VPg can function as a cap analog in cap-independent translation and potentially target PAP to uncapped IRES-containing RNA. In this work, fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC techniques were used to quantitatively describe PAP depurination activity and PAP-VPg interactions. PAP binds to VPg with high affinity (29.5 nm); the reaction is enthalpically driven and entropically favored. Further, VPg is a potent inhibitor of PAP depurination of RNA in wheat germ lysate and competes with structured RNA derived from tobacco etch virus for PAP binding.

Of these three types of kinase, the MAPKKKs exhibit the most divergence in the plant genome. Their great diversity is assumed to allow MAPKKKs to regulate many specific signaling pathways in plants despite the relatively limited number of MAPKKs and MAPKs. Although some plant MAPKKKs, including the MAPKKKÎ± of Nicotiana benthamiana (NbMAPKKKÎ±), are known to play crucial roles in plant defense responses, the functional relationship among MAPKKK genes is poorly understood.

The negatively charged sugar-phosphate backbone of RNA and DNA as well as the large positive charge of the interior surface of the virus capsids suggest that electrostatic complementarity is an important factor in the packaging of the genomes in these viruses. To test how much packing information is encoded by the electrostatic and steric envelope of the capsid interior, we performed extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of virus capsids with explicit water molecules and solvent ions. The model systems were two small plant viruses in which significant amounts of RNA has been observed by X-ray crystallography: satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV, 62% RNA visible) and satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV, 34% RNA visible). Simulations of half-capsids of these viruses with no RNA present revealed that the binding sites of RNA correlated well with regions populated by chloride ions, suggesting that it is possible to screen for the binding sites of nucleic acids by determining the equilibrium distribution of negative ions. By including the crystallographically resolved RNA in addition to ions, we predicted the localization of the unresolved RNA in the viruses. Both viruses showed a hot-spot for RNA binding at the 5-fold symmetry axis. The MD simulations were compared to predictions of the chloride density based on nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) calculations with mobile ions. Although the predictions are superficially similar, the PBE calculations overestimate the ion concentration close to the capsid surface and underestimate it far away, mainly because protein dynamics is not taken into account. Density maps from chloride screening can be used to aid in building atomic models of packaged virus genomes. Knowledge of the principles of genome packaging might be exploited for both antiviral therapy and technological applications. ",eng,2012,06,26,2012,7,10,ppublish,,,

An intriguing feature of the AMV CP is its nuclear and nucleolar accumulation. Here, we identify an N-terminal lysine-rich nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) in the AMV CP required to both enter the nucleus and accumulate in the nucleolus of infected cells, and a C-terminal leucine-rich domain which might function as a nuclear export signal. Moreover, we demonstrate that AMV CP interacts with importin-Î±, a component of the classical nuclear import pathway. A mutant AMV RNA 3 unable to target the nucleolus exhibited reduced plus-strand RNA synthesis and cell-to-cell spread. Moreover, virion formation and systemic movement were completely abolished in plants infected with this mutant. In vitro analysis demonstrated that specific lysine residues within the NoLS are also involved in modulating CP-RNA binding and CP dimerization, suggesting that the NoLS represents a multifunctional domain within the AMV CP. The observation that nuclear and nucleolar import signals mask RNA-binding properties of AMV CP, essential for viral replication and translation, supports a model in which viral expression is carefully modulated by a cytoplasmic/nuclear balance of CP accumulation.",eng,,,,2012,7,4,ppublish,"Amino Acid Sequence|Capsid Proteins|Cell Nucleolus|Cytoplasm|Lysine|Molecular Sequence Data|Mutation|Protein Multimerization|Protein Structure, Tertiary|Protein Transport|Tobacco|Virion|Virus Replication|alpha Karyopherins",D000595|D036022|D002466|D003593|D008239|D008969|D009154|D055503|D017434|D021381|D014026|D014771|D014779|D028901,

An important ingredient of our model is an allosteric switch associated with the binding of the first protein unit to the origin-of-assembly domain of the viral RNA. The subsequent addition and conformational switching of coat proteins to the growing capsid we believe is catalyzed by the presence of the helical arrangement of bound proteins to the RNA. The model explains why the formation of complete viruses is favored over incomplete ones, even though the process is quasi-one-dimensional in character. We numerically solve the relevant kinetic equations and show that time evolution is different for the assembly and disassembly of the virus, the former exhibiting a time lag even if all forward rate constants are equal.

We synthesize viral mRNA of desired lengths using simple molecular biology techniques, and in vitro assemble the mRNA with viral coat proteins to yield viral building blocks of controlled lengths. The results indicate that the assembly of the viral building blocks is consistent and reproducible, and can be readily extended to assemble building blocks with genetically modified coat proteins (TMV1cys). Additionally, we confirm the potential utility of the TMV1cys viral building blocks with controlled dimensions via covalent and quantitative conjugation of fluorescent markers.

TuMV infection led to the amalgamation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, COPII coatamers, and chloroplasts into a perinuclear globular structure that also contained viral proteins. One consequence of TuMV infection was that protein secretion was blocked at the ER-Golgi interface. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments indicated that the perinuclear structure cannot be restocked in viral components but was dynamically connected to the bulk of the Golgi apparatus and the ER. Experiments with 6K(2) fused to photoactivable green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed that production of motile peripheral 6K(2) vesicles was functionally linked to the perinuclear structure. Disruption of the early secretory pathway did not prevent the formation of the perinuclear globular structure, enhanced the clustering of peripheral 6K(2) vesicles with COPII coatamers, and led to inhibition of cell-to-cell virus movement.

Symptoms involve direct and indirect effects, which result in disruption of host physiology. We used transgenic tobacco expressing a variant of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) coat protein (CP(T42W)) or movement protein (MP), and a hybrid line (MPÃCP(T42W)) that coexpresses both proteins, to study the plant response to individual viral proteins. Findings employing microarray analysis of MPÃCP(T42W) plants and silenced mpÃcp(T42W)* controls revealed that altered transcripts were mostly downregulated, suggesting a persistent shut-off due to MPÃCP(T42W) expression. Next, we showed that MP triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, reduction of total ascorbate, and expression of ROS scavenging genes. These effects were enhanced when both proteins were coexpressed. MP and MPÃCP(T42W) plants showed increased levels of salicylic acid (SA) and SA-responsive gene expression. Furthermore, these effects were partially reproduced in Nicotiana benthamiana when GMP1 transcript was silenced. CP(T42W) seems to be playing a negative role in the defense response by reducing the expression of PR-1 and RDR-1.

Previously, metabolic turnover analysis using (13)CO(2) in tobacco leaves demonstrated that conversion of Glc6P to Glc1P may limit carbon flow into carbohydrate synthesis. In order to assess the effects of PGM, Arabidopsis thaliana cytosolic or plastidial PGM was expressed under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter in tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum cv.

In vivo(13)C-labeling experiments indicated that photosynthetically fixed carbon in the transgenic plants could be converted faster to Glc1P and adenosine 5'-diphosphate glucose than in wild-type, suggesting that elevation of plastidial PGM activity should accelerate conversion of Glc6P to Glc1P in chloroplasts and increase carbon flow into starch. On the other hand, transgenic plants expressing Arabidopsis cytosolic PGM showed a 2.1-3.4-fold increase in PGM activity over wild-type and a decrease of leaf starch content, but no change in sucrose content.

Co-inoculation of leaves with PVX and either BNYVV or TRV produced an increase in PVX negative-strand RNA and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) accumulation in roots. The cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs) BNYVV p14 and TRV 16K showed weak silencing suppression activity in leaves. However, when either of these CRPs was expressed from a PVX vector, there was an enhancement of PVX negative-strand RNA and sgRNA accumulation in roots compared with PVX alone. Such enhancement of PVX sgRNAs was also observed by expression of CRPs of other viruses and the well-known suppressors HC-Pro and p19 but not of the potato mop-top virus p8 CRP. These results indicate that BNYVV- and TRV-encoded CRPs suppress RNA silencing more efficiently in roots than in leaves.",eng,2012,05,30,2012,6,1,ppublish,"Blotting, Northern|Blotting, Western|Cysteine|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Gene Silencing|Plant Leaves|Plant Roots|Plant Shoots|Plant Viruses|RNA, Viral|Soil Microbiology|Tobacco|Viral Proteins",D015152|D015153|D003545|D018506|D020868|D018515|D018517|D018520|D010942|D012367|D012988|D014026|D014764,

The same pretreatment resulted in suppression of normosensitive necrosis associated with susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea. This type of HâOâ-mediated, induced disease symptom resistance correlated with enhanced host antioxidant capacity, i.e., elevated enzymatic activities of catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and guaiacol peroxidase (POX) after viral and bacterial infections. Induction of genes that encode the antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT, and APX was also enhanced early after TMV infection. Artificial application of SOD and CAT suppressed necroses caused by viral, bacterial, or fungal pathogens similarly as HâOâ pretreatment, implying that HâOâ-mediated symptom resistance operates through enhancement of plant antioxidant capacity. Pathogen multiplication was not significantly affected in HâOâ-pretreated plants.

Recent studies indicate a role of virus-derived siRNAs in manipulating the expression of specific host genes and that certain plant viral movement proteins (MPs) can act as viral enhancers of RNA silencing (VERs) by stimulating the spread of silencing between cells. This suggests that viruses have evolved complex responses capable to efficiently hijack the host RNA silencing machinery to their own advantage. We draw here a dynamic model of the interaction of plant viruses with the silencing machinery during invasion of the host. The model proposes that cells at the spreading front of infection, where infection starts from zero and the VSR levels are supposedly low, represent potential sites for viral manipulation of host gene expression by using virus- and host-derived small RNAs. Viral MPs may facilitate the spread of silencing to produce a wave of small RNA-mediated gene expression changes ahead of the infection to increase host susceptibility. When experimentally ascertained, this hypothetical model will call for re-defining viral movement and the function of viral MPs.",eng,2012,01,30,2012,5,29,epublish,,,RNA silencing|Tobacco mosaic virus|host:pathogen interactions|miRNA|siRNA|silencing enhancer|silencing suppressor|viruses

The accumulation of viral RNA was quantified using qPCR at 1, 2 and 8 days post infection (dpi), and two different methods were employed to predict the dominating virus.

Viroid oligomeric transcripts of both polarities contain embedded hammerhead ribozymes that, during replication, mediate their self-cleavage to monomeric-length RNAs with 5'-hydroxyl and 2',3'-phosphodiester termini that are subsequently circularized. We report that a recombinant version of the chloroplastic isoform of the tRNA ligase from eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) efficiently catalyzes in vitro circularization of the plus [(+)] and minus [(-)] monomeric linear replication intermediates from the four Avsunviroidae. We also show that while this RNA ligase specifically recognizes the genuine monomeric linear (+) ELVd replication intermediate, it does not do so with five other monomeric linear (+) ELVd RNAs with their ends mapping at different sites along the molecule, despite containing the same 5'-hydroxyl and 2',3'-phosphodiester terminal groups. Moreover, experiments involving transient expression of a dimeric (+) ELVd transcript in Nicotiana benthamiana Domin plants preinoculated with a tobacco rattle virus-derived vector to induce silencing of the plant endogenous tRNA ligase show a significant reduction of ELVd circularization. In contrast, circularization of a viroid replicating in the nucleus occurring through a different pathway is unaffected.

These observations indicated that the amino acids within the Î²-sheet domain were involved in both the induction of L(1a) gene-mediated resistance and virion formation. Further analyses using chimeric CPs of TMGMV-J and PMMoV indicated that amino acids within the Î²-sheet domain alone were not sufficient for the induction of L(1a) gene-mediated resistance by TMGMV-J CP.

In this study, the role of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and its early effects on osteoinduction with particular emphasis on the regulation of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) was examined.

An immediate increase in BMP2 gene and protein expression for cells on the TMV substrate was observed within 8 hours of osteoinduction. Moreover, BMP2 expression was highly localized to cells within the cell aggregates. This enhanced differentiation only occurred when TMV was coated on a solid support but not upon adding the virus to the media solution.

Initial symptoms were necrosis beginning at the base of leaflets that were surrounded by yellow areas. These symptoms resembled those described for Tomato torrado virus (ToTV; family Secoviridae, genus Torradovirus), which was first found in Spain (2). Other (tentative) members of the genus Torradovirus, Tomato marchitez virus (ToMarV), Tomato chocolate spot virus (ToChSV), and Tomato chocolÃ te virus (ToChV) (3) induce similar symptoms on tomato plants. One sample, coded T418, was stored in the freezer and brought to our lab in 2011. Serological tests (double-antibody sandwich-ELISA) using polyclonal antibodies (Prime Diagnostics, Wageningen, The Netherlands) on leaf extracts showed the absence of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Potato virus X (PVX), and Potato virus Y (PVY). Leaf extracts were mechanically inoculated onto the indicator plants Physalis floridana, Nicotiana hesperis '67A', and N. occidentalis 'P1' (six plants in total) and were kept in a greenhouse at 20Â°C with 16 h of light. Necrotic symptoms appeared 4 to 5 days postinoculation and resembled those described for ToTV (2). Two dip preparations of systemically infected P. floridana and N. occidentalis leaves were examined by electron microscopy, which revealed the presence of spherical virus particles of approximately 30 nm. To confirm the presence of ToTV, total RNA was extracted from the original leaf material and an inoculated P. floridana and N. occidentalis plant using the Qiagen Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer's instructions. ToTV-specific primer sets ToTV-Dp33F/ToTV-Dp20R (5'-TGCTCAATGTTGGAAACCCC-3'/5'-AGCCCTTCATAGGCTAGCC-3', amplifying a fragment of the RNA1 polyprotein with an expected size of 751 bp) and ToTV-Dp1F/ToTV-Dp2R (5'-ACAAGAGGAGCTTGACGAGG-3'/5'-AAAGGTAGTGTAATGGTCGG-3', amplifying a fragment on the RNA2 movement protein region with an expected size of 568 bp) were used to amplify the indicated regions in a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using the One-Step Access RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI). Amplicons of the predicted size were obtained in all tested materials. The PCR products were purified with the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced directly. BLAST analyses of the obtained sequences (GenBank Accession Nos. JQ314230 and JQ314229) confirmed the identity of isolate T418 as ToTV, with 99% identity to isolate PRI-ToTV0301 in both fragments (GenBank Accession Nos.

In this study, the hemagglutinin (HA) of a low pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H7N7 subtype isolated from a Swedish mallard Anas platyrhynchos was sequenced, characterized and transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. Recently, plant expression systems have gained interest as an alternative for the production of vaccine antigens. To examine the possibility of expressing the HA protein in N. benthamiana, a cDNA fragment encoding the HA gene was synthesized de novo, modified with a Kozak sequence, a PR1a signal peptide, a C-terminal hexahistidine (6ÃHis) tag, and an endoplasmic retention signal (SEKDEL). The construct was cloned into a Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV)-based vector (pEAQ-HT) and the resulting pEAQ-HT-HA plasmid, along with a vector (pJL3:p19) containing the viral gene-silencing suppressor p19 from Tomato bushy stunt virus, was agro-infiltrated into N. benthamiana. The highest gene expression of recombinant plant-produced, uncleaved HA (rHA0), as measured by quantitative real-time PCR was detected at 6 days post infiltration (dpi). Guided by the gene expression profile, rHA0 protein was extracted at 6 dpi and subsequently purified utilizing the 6ÃHis tag and immobilized metal ion adsorption chromatography. The yield was 0.2 g purified protein per kg fresh weight of leaves. Further molecular characterizations showed that the purified rHA0 protein was N-glycosylated and its identity confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, the purified rHA0 exhibited hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition activity indicating that the rHA0 shares structural and functional properties with native HA protein of H7 influenza virus.

However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. We have observed previously that in FHV and BMV, unlike ectopically expressed capsid protein (CP), packaging specificity results from RNA encapsidation by CP that has been translated from mRNA produced from replicating genomic RNA. Consequently, we hypothesize that a physical interaction with replicase increases the CP specificity for packaging viral RNAs. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating the molecular interaction between replicase protein and CP using a FHV-Nicotiana benthamiana system. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation in conjunction with fluorescent cellular protein markers and coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that FHV replicase (protein A) and CP physically interact at the mitochondrial site of replication and that this interaction requires the N-proximal region from either amino acids 1 to 31 or amino acids 32 to 50 of the CP. In contrast to the mitochondrial localization of CP derived from FHV replication, ectopic expression displayed a characteristic punctate pattern on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pattern was altered to relocalize the CP throughout the cytoplasm when the C-proximal hydrophobic domain was deleted. Analysis of the packaging phenotypes of the CP mutants defective either in protein A-CP interactions or ER localization suggested that synchronization between protein A-CP interaction and its subcellular localization is imperative to confer packaging specificity.",eng,2012,03,21,2012,3,23,ppublish,"Capsid Proteins|Immunoprecipitation|Microscopy, Fluorescence|Mutant Proteins|Nodaviridae|Protein Binding|Protein Interaction Mapping|RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase|Sequence Deletion|Tobacco|Virus Assembly",D036022|D047468|D008856|D050505|D030381|D011485|D025941|D012324|D017384|D014026|D019065,

Based on structure, PD in immature tissues are classified into two types, simple and branched (X- and Y-shaped) or twinned. The maximum size of molecules capable of PD transport defines PD aperture, known as the PD size exclusion limit. Here we report an Arabidopsis mutation, decreased size exclusion limit1 (dse1), that exhibits reduced cell-to-cell transport of the small (524 Da) fluorescent tracer 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid at the midtorpedo stage of embryogenesis. Correspondingly, the fraction of X- and Y-shaped and twinned PD was reduced in dse1 embryos compared with WT embryos at this stage, suggesting that the frequency of PD is related to transport capability. dse1 is caused by a point mutation in At4g29860 (previously termed TANMEI) at the last donor splice site of its transcript, resulting in alternative splicing in both the first intron and the last intron. AtDSE1 is a conserved eukaryotic 386-aa WD-repeat protein critical for Arabidopsis morphogenesis and reproduction. Similar to its homologs in mouse, null mutants are embryo-lethal. The weak loss-of-function mutant dse1 exhibits pleiotropic phenotypes, including retarded vegetative growth, delayed flowering time, dysfunctional male and female organs, and delayed senescence. Finally, silencing of DSE1 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves leads to reduced movement of GFP fused to tobacco mosaic virus movement protein.

Consequently, study of encapsidation deciphers the information regarding the know-how of the mechanism regulating virus assembly to form infectious virions. Such information is vital in formulating novel methods of curbing virus spread and disease control. Virus encapsidation can be studied in vivo and in vitro. Genome encapsidation in vivo is a highly regulated selective process involving macromolecular interactions and subcellular compartmentalization. Therefore, study leading to dissect events encompassing virus encapsidation in vivo would provide basic knowledge to understand how viruses proliferate and assemble. Recently in vitro encapsidation has been exploited for the research in the area of biomedical imaging and therapeutic applications. Non-enveloped plant viruses stand far ahead in the venture of in vitro encapsidation of the negatively charged foreign material. Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a non-enveloped multicomponent RNA virus pathogenic to plants, has been used as a model system for studying genome packaging in vivo and in vitro. For encapsidation assays in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, Agrobacterium -mediated transient expression, refer to as agroinfiltration, is an efficient and robust technique for the synchronized delivery and expression of multiple components to the same cell. In this approach, a suspension of Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells carrying binary plasmid vectors carrying cDNAs of desiredviral mRNAs is infiltrated into the intercellular space withina leaf using nothing more sophisticated than a 1 ml disposable syringe (without needle). This process results in the transfer of DNA insert into plant cells; the T-DNA insert remains transiently in the nucleus and is then transcribed by the host polymerase II, leading to the transient expression. The resulting mRNA transcript (capped and polyadenylated) is then exported to the cytoplasm for translation. After approximately 24 to 48 hours of incubation,sections of infiltrated leaves can be sampled for microscopyor biochemical analyses. Agroinfiltration permits large numbers (hundreds to thousands) of cells to be transfected simultaneously. For in vitro encapsidation, purified virions of BMV are dissociated into capsid protein by dialyzing against dissociation buffer containing calcium chloride followed by removal of RNA and un-dissociated virions by centrifugation. Genome depleted capsid protein subunits are then reassembled with desired viral genome components or non-viral components such as indocyanine dye.",eng,2012,03,01,2012,3,14,epublish,Agrobacterium tumefaciens|Bromovirus|Tobacco|Virus Assembly,D016960|D017795|D014026|D019065,

The mRNA level of NbMPB2Cb was increased upon infection by PVX and Tobacco mosaic virus. The movement of PVX was reduced by overexpression of NbMPB2Cb and increased by silenced of NbMPB2Cb. In contrast, PVX RNA accumulation was not significantly altered in protoplasts. Protein-protein interaction assays showed that NbMPB2Cb interacts with PVX movement-associated proteins. PVX infection altered the subcellular localization of NbMPB2Cb from microtubules to endoplasmic reticulum.

Many symptomatic plants were observed. The most common leaf symptoms were yellow mottle, yellow streaks, and chlorotic and necrotic ringspots. Leaf samples were collected from eight symptomatic plants from the following genera: Encyclia, Oncidium, Shomburghia, Brassia, Guarianthe, Cattleya, Epidendrum, Vanilla, Xilobium, Laelia, and Brassocattleya. Samples were tested using double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA (Agdia, Elkhart, IN) with antiserum for Cymbidium mosaic virus (CymMV), Odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV), Cymbidium ringspot mosaic virus, and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and a general antiserum for potyviruses. At least one plant from each genus was positive to CymMV and ORSV as individual or mixed infections. Encyclia and Laelia plants were the most frequently found with mixed infections by both viruses. All genera were negative for TMV and potyviruses. Total RNA extracts were obtained from all ELISA-positive samples by a modified silica capture protocol (2). Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was carried out with general polymerase (RdRp) gene primers corresponding to the Potexvirus group (3) and specific primers for the coat protein gene (CP) of CymMV and ORSV (1). The PCR amplification from a positive sample of each genus was resolved in agarose gels. Amplification products of the expected size were obtained for CymMV and ORSV. Five CymMV RdRp gene clones from five different plants of Laelia (GenBank Accession Nos. HQ393958, HQ393959, HQ393960, HQ393961, and HQ393962), two CP gene clones of CP gene of CymMV from two different plants of Oncidium (GenBank Accession Nos.

The C2 protein of bhendi yellow vein mosaic virus (BYVMV) is a suppressor of post-transcriptional gene silencing and also functions as a transcriptional activator. To explore the molecular mechanisms of its nuclear trafficking and self-interaction, fusion proteins of fluorescent proteins with wild-type or mutated constructs of BYVMV C2 were expressed in tobacco protoplasts. Analyses revealed that the BYVMV C2 nuclear localization signal (NLS) was located in the N terminus of the protein, comprising aa 17-31 of C2. NLSs are recognized by a class of soluble transport receptors termed karyopherins Î± and Î². The BYVMV C2 NLS was found to be necessary for this protein's interaction with its nuclear import mediator, karyopherin Î±, ensuring its nuclear localization. Nevertheless, when deleted, C2 was found in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, suggesting NLS-independent nuclear import of this protein.

Here, by agroinfiltrating Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, we show that brome mosaic virus (BMV) replicase is competent to initiate positive-strand [(+)-strand] synthesis on an ectopically expressed RNA3 negative strand [(-) strand] and faithfully complete the replication cycle. Consequently, we sought to examine the role of RNA polarity in BMV recombination by expressing a series of replication-defective mutants of BMV RNA3 in (+) or (-) polarity. Temporal analysis of progeny sequences revealed that the genetic makeup of the primary recombinant pool is determined by the polarity of the inoculum template. When the polarity of the inoculum template was (+), the recombinant pool that accumulated during early phases of replication was a mixture of nonhomologous recombinants. These are longer than the inoculum template length, and a nascent 3' untranslated region (UTR) of wild-type (WT) RNA1 or RNA2 was added to the input mutant RNA3 3' UTR due to end-to-end template switching by BMV replicase during (-)-strand synthesis. In contrast, when the polarity of the inoculum was (-), the progeny contained a pool of native-length homologous recombinants generated by template switching of BMV replicase with a nascent UTR from WT RNA1 or RNA2 during (+)-strand synthesis. Repair of a point mutation caused by polymerase error occurred only when the polarity of the inoculum template was (+).

To counteract this, several plant viruses express silencing suppressors that inhibit RNA silencing in host plants. Here, we show that both 2b protein from peanut stunt virus (PSV) and a hairpin construct (designated hp-RDR6) that silences endogenous RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) strongly suppress RNA silencing. The Agrobacterium infiltration system was used to demonstrate that both PSV 2b and hp-RDR6 suppressed local RNA silencing as strongly as helper component (HC-Pro) from potato virus Y (PVY) and P19 from tomato bush stunt virus (TBSV). The 2b protein from PSV eliminated the small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) associated with RNA silencing and prevented systemic silencing, similar to 2b protein from cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). On the other hand, hp-RDR6 suppressed RNA silencing by inhibiting the generation of secondary siRNAs. The small coat protein (SCP) of squash mosaic virus (SqMV) also displayed weak suppression activity of RNA silencing. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer was used to investigate whether viral silencing suppressors or hp-RDR6 enhanced accumulations of green fluorescence protein (GFP) and Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) as markers of expression in leaf tissues of Nicotina benthamiana. Expression of both GFP and GUS was significantly enhanced in the presence of PSV 2b or CMV 2b, compared to no suppression or the weak SqMV SCP suppressor.

This study analyzed the resistance of certain Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes to a potexvirus, plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV). Map-based positional cloning revealed that the lectin gene JACALIN-TYPE LECTIN REQUIRED FOR POTEXVIRUS RESISTANCE1 (JAX1) is responsible for the resistance. JAX1-mediated resistance did not show the properties of conventional resistance (R) protein-mediated resistance and was independent of plant defense hormone signaling. Heterologous expression of JAX1 in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that JAX1 interferes with infection by other tested potexviruses but not with plant viruses from different genera, indicating the broad but specific resistance to potexviruses conferred by JAX1. In contrast with the lectin gene RESTRICTED TEV MOVEMENT1, which inhibits the systemic movement of potyviruses, which are distantly related to potexviruses, JAX1 impairs the accumulation of PlAMV RNA at the cellular level.

We identified microRNA (miRNA) progenitor genes precursor transcripts, and two miRNAs [nta-miR6019 (22-nt) and nta-miR6020 (21-nt)] that guide cleavage of transcripts of the Toll and Interleukin-1 receptor-NB-LRR immune receptor N from tobacco that confers resistance to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).

A systematic alanine-scanning mutagenesis study established the region K(122)-D(258) of the pc4 substantially associated with cell-to-cell movement, and mutants by replacement of KGR(122-124), D(135), ED(170-171), ER(201-202), EFE(218-220) or ELD(256-258) with alanine(s) no longer moved cell to cell. However, only one amino acid group KGR(122-124) was linked with long-distance movement. The region D(17)-K(33) was recognized as a crucial domain for leaf necrosis response, and mutagenesis of DD(17-18) or RK(32-33) greatly attenuated necrosis. The overall data suggested manifold roles of the pc4 during the RSV infection in its experimental host N. benthamiana.",eng,2012,02,02,2012,2,7,ppublish,Amino Acid Motifs|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Tenuivirus|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Viral Proteins,D020816|D010935|D018515|D029364|D014026|D014027|D014764,

Virions of filamentous viruses have numerous mechanical functions, including cell entry, viral disassembly, viral assembly, and cell exit. The plant viruses, which infect multicellular organisms, also use virions or virion-like assemblies for transport within the host. Plant viruses are generally self-assembling; filamentous bacteriophage assembly is combined with secretion from the host cell, using a complex molecular machine.

The N-terminal 50 amino acids of the Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) CP are rich in basic residues (especially lysine) and are essential for the core functions of the CP, namely RNA binding and virion assembly. To further elucidate additional biological roles for these basic residues, a series of alanine substitution mutations was introduced into infectious clones of RCNMV RNA-1 and assayed for symptomatology, virion formation and systemic infection. Infectivity assays conducted in Nicotiana benthamiana revealed that all nine alanine substitution mutants (ASMs) were competent for systemic infection. Two ASMs (K4A and K7A/K8A) induced severe symptoms and delayed the systemic spread of viral genomes when compared with wild-type RCNMV. However, these ASMs were still competent for virion formation. Three other ASMs (K25A, K33A and K38A) displayed milder symptoms and significant reductions in virion accumulation when compared with wild-type RCNMV, but retained the ability to spread systemically. Evidence from these last three ASMs, as well as a CP null mutant, showed that RCNMV is able to move systemically in N. benthamiana as a nonvirion form. These observations reaffirm the necessity of the N-terminal lysine-rich residues of the RCNMV CP for efficient virion accumulation. They also reveal additional roles for the CP in the modulation of host symptomatology, independent of its role in virion assembly and the rate of systemic viral movement in N. benthamiana.",eng,2012,02,01,2012,2,2,ppublish,"Alanine|Amino Acid Motifs|Amino Acid Sequence|Amino Acid Substitution|Capsid Proteins|Genome, Viral|Lysine|Molecular Sequence Data|Mutation|Plant Diseases|Plant Viral Movement Proteins|RNA, Viral|Sequence Alignment|Structure-Activity Relationship|Tobacco|Tombusviridae|Virion",D000409|D020816|D000595|D019943|D036022|D016679|D008239|D008969|D009154|D010935|D053830|D012367|D016415|D013329|D014026|D019183|D014771,

Certain satBaMVs isolated from natural fields significantly interfere with BaMV replication. The 5' apical hairpin stem loop (AHSL) of satBaMV is the major determinant in interference with BaMV replication. In this study, by in vivo competition assay, we revealed that the sequence and structure of AHSL, along with specific nucleotides (C(60) and C(83)) required for interference with BaMV replication, are also involved in replication competition among satBaMV variants. Moreover, all of the 5' ends of natural BaMV isolates contain the similar AHSLs having conserved nucleotides (C(64) and C(86)) with those of interfering satBaMVs, suggesting their co-evolution. Mutational analyses revealed that C(86) was essential for BaMV replication, and that replacement of C(64) with U reduced replication efficiency. The non-interfering satBaMV interfered with BaMV replication with the BaMV-C64U mutant as helper. These findings suggest that two cytosines at the equivalent positions in the AHSLs of BaMV and satBaMV play a crucial role in replication competence.

However, little is known about the changes in gene expression and phytohormone levels associated with cell death caused by compatible viruses. The synergistic interaction of Potato virus X (PVX) with a number of Potyvirus spp. results in increased symptoms that lead to systemic necrosis (SN) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Here, we show that SN induced by a PVX recombinant virus expressing a potyviral helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) gene is associated with PCD. We have also compared transcriptomic and hormonal changes that occur in response to a compatible synergistic virus interaction that leads to SN, a systemic incompatible interaction conferred by the Tobacco mosaic virus-resistance gene N, and a PCD response conditioned by depletion of proteasome function. Our analysis indicates that the SN response clusters with the incompatible response by the similarity of their overall gene expression profiles. However, the expression profiles of both defense-related genes and hormone-responsive genes, and also the relative accumulation of several hormones in response to SN, relate more closely to the response to depletion of proteasome function than to that elicited by the incompatible interaction. This suggests a potential contribution of proteasome dysfunction to the increased pathogenicity observed in PVX-Potyvirus mixed infections.

We examined the potential of producing HPV-8 major CP L1 in Nicotiana benthamiana by agroinfiltration of different transient expression vectors: (i) the binary vector pBIN19 with or without silencing suppressor constructs, (ii) the nonreplicating Cowpea mosaic virus-derived expression vector pEAQ-HT and (iii) a replicating Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV)-based vector alone or with signal peptides.

In contrast, no L1 protein could be immune detected using pBIN19 irrespective of whether silencing suppressors were coexpressed, although such constructs were required for identifying L1-specific transcripts. A fourfold yield increase in L1 expression was obtained when 22 C-terminal amino acids were deleted (L1ÎC22), possibly eliminating a nuclear localization signal.

The 3'-derivative species is similar to the previously reported subgenomic RNA3 produced during virus infection. 5' RACE revealed that the truncated forms had identical 5' ends. The 5' termini carried the coremin motif also present on BNYVV RNA5, beet soil-borne mosaic virus RNA3 and 4, and cucumber mosaic virus group 2 RNAs.

Their numerous advantages make fluorescent proteins the markers of choice in most studies. However, the use of fluorescent proteins still has some limitations, such as the need of specialized material and facilities to detect the fluorescence. Here, we demonstrate a visual reporter marker system to track virus infection and movement through the plant. The reporter system is based on expression of Antirrhinum majus MYB-related Rosea1 (Ros1) transcription factor (220 amino acids; 25.7 kD) that activates a series of biosynthetic genes leading to accumulation of colored anthocyanins. Using two different tobacco etch potyvirus recombinant clones tagged with Ros1, we show that infected tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) tissues turn bright red, demonstrating that in this context, the sole expression of Ros1 is sufficient to induce pigment accumulation to a level readily detectable to the naked eye. This marker system also reports viral load qualitatively and quantitatively by means of a very simple extraction process. The Ros1 marker remained stable within the potyvirus genome through successive infectious passages from plant to plant. The main limitation of this marker system is that color output will depend on each particular plant host-virus combination and must be previously tested.

In animal cells this proteolytic activity belongs to caspases, a well-characterized family of cysteine-dependent death proteases. Plants, however, lack caspase homologs and thus the origin of this type of proteolytic activity in planta was poorly understood. Here, we review recent data demonstrating that a plant serine-dependent protease, phytaspase, shares cleavage specificity and a role in PCD analogous to that of caspases. However, unlike caspases, regulation of phytaspase-mediated cleavage of intracellular target proteins appears to be attained not at the level of proenzyme processing/activation, which occurs, in the case of phytaspase, autocatalytically and constitutively. Rather, the mature phytaspase is excluded from healthy cells into the apoplast and is allowed to re-enter cells upon the induction of PCD. Thus, PCD-related proteases in animals and plants display both common features and important distinctions.",eng,2012,01,28,2011,12,21,ppublish,Animals|Antiviral Agents|Caspases|Catalytic Domain|Cell Death|Enzyme Activation|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Plant Diseases|Plant Proteins|Proteolysis|Species Specificity|Substrate Specificity|Subtilisins|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus,D000818|D000998|D020169|D020134|D016923|D004789|D054884|D010935|D010940|D059748|D013045|D013379|D013381|D014026|D014027,

In the case of Potato virus X (PVX), it carries stem-loop 1 (SL1) RNA essential for viral replication and movement. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis northwestern blot analysis, we previously identified several host proteins that bind to SL1 RNA. Of those, we further characterized a DnaJ-like protein from Nicotiana benthamiana named NbDnaJ. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that NbDnaJ binds only to SL1 minus-strand RNA, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) indicated that NbDnaJ interacts with PVX capsid protein (CP). Using a series of deletion mutants, the C-terminal region of NbDnaJ was found to be essential for the interaction with PVX CP. The expression of NbDnaJ significantly changed upon infection with different plant viruses such as PVX, Tobacco mosaic virus, and Cucumber mosaic virus, but varied depending on the viral species. In transient experiments, both PVX replication and movement were inhibited in plants that over-expressed NbDnaJ but accelerated in plants in which NbDnaJ was silenced. In summary, we suggest that the newly identified NbDnaJ plays a role in PVX replication and movement by interacting with SL1(-) RNA and PVX CP.",eng,2011,12,07,2011,12,15,ppublish,"Amino Acid Sequence|Capsid Proteins|Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay|HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins|Host-Pathogen Interactions|Molecular Sequence Data|Nucleic Acid Conformation|Phylogeny|Plant Proteins|Potexvirus|RNA, Viral|Tobacco|Virus Replication",D000595|D036022|D024202|D050956|D054884|D008969|D009690|D010802|D010940|D017863|D012367|D014026|D014779,

In this study we investigated the effects of sulfate (S) supply on the response of genetically resistant tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun NN) to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Plants grown with sufficient sulfate (+S plants) developed significantly less necrotic lesions during a hypersensitive response (HR) when compared to plants grown without sulfate (-S plants). InÂ +S plants reduced TMV accumulation was evident on the level of viral RNA. Enhanced virus resistance correlated with elevated levels of cysteine and glutathione and early induction of a Tau class glutathione S-transferase and a salicylic acid-binding catalase gene. These data indicate that the elevated antioxidant capacity ofÂ +S plants was able to reduce the effects of HR, leading to enhanced virus resistance. Expression of pathogenesis-related genes was also markedly up-regulated inÂ +S plants after TMV-inoculation. On the subcellular level, comparison of TMV-inoculatedÂ +S andÂ -S plants revealed thatÂ +S plants contained 55-132 % higher glutathione levels in mitochondria, chloroplasts, nuclei, peroxisomes and the cytosol thanÂ -S plants. Interestingly, mitochondria were the only organelles where TMV-inoculation resulted in a decrease of glutathione levels when compared to mock-inoculated plants. This was particularly obvious inÂ -S plants, where the development of necrotic lesions was more pronounced. In summary, the overall higher antioxidative capacity and elevated activation of defense genes inÂ +S plants indicate that sufficient sulfate supply enhances a preexisting plant defense reaction resulting in reduced symptom development and virus accumulation.",eng,2011,11,07,2011,11,30,ppublish,"Antioxidants|Cell Compartmentation|Cell Death|Cell Nucleus|Cysteine|Disease Resistance|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Glutathione|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plant Proteins|RNA, Plant|RNA, Viral|Reactive Oxygen Species|Salicylic Acid|Sulfates|Sulfur|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus",D000975|D002451|D016923|D002467|D003545|D060467|D018506|D005978|D010935|D018515|D010940|D018749|D012367|D017382|D020156|D013431|D013455|D014026|D014027,

Ginsenosides, a class of tetracyclic triterpene saponins, are mainly responsible for its pharmacological activity. Most ginsenosides are composed of dammarenediol-II aglycone with various sugar moieties. Dammarenediol-II synthase is the first enzyme in the biosynthesis of ginsenosides. Here, we report that transgenic tobacco expressing the P. ginseng dammarenediol-II synthase gene (PgDDS) produced dammarenediol-II, and conferred resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Upon infection with TMV, lesions developed more rapidly in transgenic tobacco plants, and their size was smaller than those of wild-type plants. Transgenic tobacco plants showed a low level of both the viral titer and mRNA accumulation of TMV coat protein (CP) compared with the wild type. The production of dammarenediol-II in transgenic tobacco stimulated the expression of tobacco pathogenesis-related genes (PR1 and PR2) under both virus-untreated and -treated conditions. When the leaves of wild-type plants were inoculated with a mixture of TMV and dammarenediol-II, the leaves exhibited a reduced viral concentration and TMV-CP expression than those receiving TMV treatment alone. When the leaves of P. ginseng were infected with TMV, transcription of PgDDS was significantly increased. Transgenic P. ginseng plants harboring a Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) gene driven by the PgDDS promoter were constructed. The GUS expression was activated when the transgenic ginseng plants were treated with TMV. These results indicate that the medicinally important dammarenediol-II can be ectopically produced in tobacco, and the production of dammarenediol-II in tobacco plants allows them to adopt a viral defense system.",eng,2011,11,18,2011,11,22,ppublish,"Alkyl and Aryl Transferases|Disease Resistance|Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry|Gene Expression Profiling|Gene Expression Regulation, Plant|Genes, Plant|Plant Diseases|Plants, Genetically Modified|Promoter Regions, Genetic|Saponins|Tobacco|Tobacco Mosaic Virus|Transcription, Genetic|Triterpenes",D019883|D060467|D008401|D020869|D018506|D017343|D010935|D030821|D011401|D012503|D014026|D014027|D014158|D014315,

However, such broad spectrum protection against biotic stress is provided by a single protein in some medicinal plants. Therefore, tobacco chloroplasts were transformed with the agglutinin gene from Pinellia ternata (pta), a widely cultivated Chinese medicinal herb. Pinellia ternata agglutinin (PTA) was expressed up to 9.2% of total soluble protein in mature leaves. Purified PTA showed similar hemagglutination activity as snowdrop lectin. Artificial diet with purified PTA from transplastomic plants showed marked and broad insecticidal activity. In planta bioassays conducted with T0 or T1 generation PTA lines showed that the growth of aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) was reduced by 89%-92% when compared with untransformed (UT) plants. Similarly, the larval survival and total population of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) on transplastomic lines were reduced by 91%-93% when compared with UT plants. This is indeed the first report of lectin controlling whitefly infestation. When transplastomic PTA leaves were fed to corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea), tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens) or the beet armyworm (spodoptera exigua), 100% mortality was observed against all these three insects. In planta bioassays revealed Erwinia population to be 10,000-fold higher in control than in PTA lines. Similar results were observed with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) challenge.

The virus, tentatively named raspberry leaf blotch virus (RLBV), has five RNAs that each potentially encode a single protein on the complementary strand. RNAs 1, 2 and 3 encode, respectively, a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a glycoprotein precursor and the nucleocapsid. RNA4 encodes a protein with sequence similarity to proteins of unknown function that are encoded by the genomes of other emaraviruses. When expressed transiently in plants fused to green or red fluorescent protein, the RLBV P4 protein localized to the peripheral cell membrane and to punctate spots in the cell wall. These spots co-localized with GFP-tagged tobacco mosaic virus 30K cell-to-cell movement protein, which is itself known to associate with plasmodesmata. These results suggest that the P4 protein may be a movement protein for RLBV. The fifth RLBV RNA, encoding the P5 protein, is unique among the sequenced emaraviruses.

Recombinant P20 (rP20) was phosphorylated by host cellular kinase(s) in vitro, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry and mutational analyses revealed Ser-11 as the phosphorylation site. The phosphor-mimic rP20 protein interactions with satBaMV-translated mutant P20 were affected. In overlay assay, the Asp mutation at S11 (S11D) completely abolished the self-interaction of rP20 and significantly inhibited the interaction with both the WT and S11A rP20. In chemical cross-linking assays, S11D failed to oligomerize. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and subsequent Hill transformation analysis revealed a low affinity of the phospho-mimicking rP20 for satBaMV RNA. Substantial modulation of satBaMV RNA conformation upon interaction with nonphospho-mimic rP20 in circular dichroism analysis indicated formation of stable satBaMV ribonucleoprotein complexes. The dissimilar satBaMV translation regulation of the nonphospho- and phospho-mimic rP20 suggests that phosphorylation of P20 in the ribonucleoprotein complex converts the translation-incompetent satBaMV RNA to messenger RNA.

These mixed infections have been suggested to result in recombinations, emergence of new viruses and new disease epidemics. We previously reported the occurrence of mixed infection between African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) and East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus (EACMCV) resulting in severe symptoms in cassava fields in Cameroon. Here, we show that reassortment of DNA-A and DNA-B components of ACMV and EACMCV does not form viable recombinants. However, in the presence of both components of either virus, the DNA-A component of the other virus replicated and spread in the absence of its DNA-B component. This result suggests that failure of ACMV and EACMCV to form viable recombinants is due to the inability of each DNA-A component to trans-replicate the heterologous DNA-B component. This study also shows that ACMV DNA-A induces a resistance to ACMV and EACMCV as indicated by absence or late symptom development. Moreover, this resistance enabled plants to recover from severe symptoms caused by EACMCV in Nicotiana benthamiana, suggesting that the resistance induced is not specific to ACMV and is consistent with the phenomenon of cross-protection between related viruses.",eng,2011,09,12,2011,9,20,ppublish,"Base Sequence|Begomovirus|Cameroon|Cross Protection|DNA, Viral|Microbial Viability|Molecular Sequence Data|Plant Diseases|Reassortant Viruses|Recombination, Genetic|Tobacco",D001483|D053839|D002163|D056738|D004279|D050296|D008969|D010935|D016865|D011995|D014026,

The 5' end of CMV RNAs was cleaved preferentially at residues that had multiple-base complementarity to the 3' end of the RSV template. The length requirement for CMV capped primers to be suitable for elongation varied between 12 and 20 nt, and those of 12-16 nt were optimal for elongation and generated more CMV-RSV chimeric mRNA transcripts. The original cap donors that were cleaved from CMV RNAs were predominantly short (10-13 nt). However, the CMV capped RNA leaders that underwent long-distance elongation were found to contain up to five repetitions of additional AC dinucleotides. Sequence analysis revealed that these AC dinucleotides were used to increase the size of short cap donors in multiple prime-and-realign cycles. Each prime-and-realign cycle added an AC dinucleotide onto the capped RNA leaders; thus, the original cap donors were gradually converted to longer capped RNA leaders (of 12-20 nt). Interestingly, the original 10 nt (or 11 nt) cap donor cleaved from CMV RNA1/2 did not undergo direct extension; only capped RNA leaders that had been increased to â¥12 nt were used for direct elongation. These findings suggest that this repetitive priming and realignment may serve to convert short capped CMV RNA leaders into longer, more suitable sizes to render a more stabilized transcription complex for elongation during RSV transcription initiation.",eng,2011,09,14,2011,9,16,ppublish,"5' Untranslated Regions|Base Sequence|Coinfection|Cucumovirus|Molecular Sequence Data|Plant Diseases|RNA Caps|RNA, Viral|Templates, Genetic|Tenuivirus|Tobacco|Transcription, Genetic",D020121|D001483|D060085|D017799|D008969|D010935|D012315|D012367|D013698|D029364|D014026|D014158,

To dissect the relationships between spatial infection patterns and the 2b protein (2b) of CMV in single or mixed infections, the CMV vectors expressing enhanced green fluorescent or Discosoma sp. red fluorescent proteins (EGFP [EG] or DsRed2 [Ds], respectively were constructed from the same wild-type CMV-Y and used for inoculation onto N. benthamiana. CMV2-A1 vector (C2-A1 [A1]) has a functional 2b while CMV-H1 vector (C2-H1 [H1]) is 2b deficient. As we expected from the 2b function as an RNA silencing suppressor (RSS), in a single infection, A1Ds retained a high level of accumulation at initial infection sites and showed extensive fluorescence in upper, noninoculated leaves, whereas H1Ds disappeared rapidly at initial infection sites and could not spread efficiently in upper, noninoculated leaf tissues. In various mixed infections, we found two phenomena providing novel insights into the relationships among RSS, viral synergism, and interference. First, H1Ds could not spread efficiently from vasculature into nonvascular tissues with or without TuMV, suggesting that RNA silencing was not involved in CMV unloading from vasculature. These results indicated that 2b could promote CMV to unload from vasculature into nonvascular tissues, and that this 2b function might be independent of its RSS activity. Second, we detected spatial interference (local interference) between A1Ds and A1EG in mixed infection with TuMV, between A1Ds (or H1Ds) and TuMV, and between H1Ds and H1EG. This observation suggested that local interference between two viruses was established even in the synergism between CMV and TuMV and, again, RNA silencing did not seem to contribute greatly to this phenomenon.",eng,,,,2011,9,16,ppublish,"Coinfection|Cucumovirus|DNA, Complementary|Gene Expression|Green Fluorescent Proteins|Luminescent Proteins|Microbial Interactions|Plant Diseases|Plant Leaves|Plants, Genetically Modified|Potyvirus|Protoplasts|RNA Interference|RNA, Messenger|RNA, Viral|Sequence Analysis, DNA|Temperature|Tobacco|Viral Proteins",D060085|D017799|D018076|D015870|D049452|D008164|D056265|D010935|D018515|D030821|D017800|D011523|D034622|D012333|D012367|D017422|D013696|D014026|D014764,

Symptoms produced by inoculation with clones were indistinguishable from those produced by inoculation with sap from symptomatic plants. Viral RNA accumulation of SYCMV was detected in the upper leaves by Northern blotting. This indicated that full-length clones of SYCMV were sufficient to produce disease symptoms.

The results showed that TMV inoculation significantly increased the level of AOX gene transcripts, ubiquinone reduction levels, pyruvate content, and cyanide-resistant respiration (CN-resistant R) in upper, un-inoculated leaves. Pretreatment with potassium cyanide (KCN, a cytochrome pathway inhibitor) greatly increased CN-resistant R and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, while application of salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, an AOX inhibitor) blocked the AOX activity and enhanced the production of ROS in the plants. Furthermore, TMV systemic infection was enhanced by SHAM and reduced by KCN pretreatment, as compared with the un-pretreated TMV counterpart. In addition, KCN application significantly diminished TMV-induced increase in antioxidant enzyme activities and dehydroascorbate/total ascorbate pool, while an opposite change was observed with SHAM-pretreated plants.

Owing to the pressure of natural evolution and human exploration, some of these viruses may be able to invade human beings. If their 'fresh' host had no defences, the viruses could cause a serious pandemic, as seen with HIV, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and avian influenza virus that originated from chimpanzees, the common palm civet and birds, respectively. It is unknown whether the human immune system could tolerate invasion with a plant virus. To model such an alien virus invasion, we chose TMV (tobacco mosaic virus) and used human epithelial carcinoma cells (HeLa cells) as its 'fresh' host. We established a reliable system for transfecting TMV-RNA into HeLa cells and found that TMV-RNA triggered autophagy in HeLa cells as shown by the appearance of autophagic vacuoles, the conversion of LC3-I (light chain protein 3-I) to LC3-II, the up-regulated expression of Beclin1 and the accumulation of TMV protein on autophagosomal membranes. We observed suspected TMV virions in HeLa cells by TEM (transmission electron microscopy). Furthermore, we found that TMV-RNA was translated into CP (coat protein) in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and that TMV-positive RNA translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleolus. Finally, we detected greatly increased expression of GRP78 (78Â kDa glucose-regulated protein), a typical marker of ERS (ER stress) and found that the formation of autophagosomes was closely related to the expanded ER membrane.

HS185 has some characteristics of a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE), such as terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) (GGTCCCACA) and a putative target site duplication. There are 362 copies of homologous sequences of HS185 in the rice genome, which are preferentially distributed to non-coding regions. Based on these sequence features, we propose that HS185 is an uncharacterized rice MITE, possibly derived from the rice transposon Mutator-like element VIII family. Further transient expression assays showed that HS185 inhibited the enhancer activity of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter.
